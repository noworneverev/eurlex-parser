    "preamble": {
        "text": "THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 53(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (2),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),\nWhereas:\n(1) Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) were adopted in response to the financial crises that unfolded in 2007-2008. Those legislative measures have substantially contributed to strengthening the financial system in the Union and rendered institutions more resilient to possible future shocks. Although extremely comprehensive, those measures did not address all identified weaknesses affecting institutions. In addition, some of the initially proposed measures were subject to review clauses or were not sufficiently detailed to allow for their smooth implementation.\n(2) This Directive aims to address issues raised in relation to the provisions of Directive 2013/36/EU that proved not to be sufficiently clear and have therefore been subject to divergent interpretations or that have been found to be overly burdensome for certain institutions. It also contains adjustments to Directive 2013/36/EU that are necessary following either the adoption of other relevant Union legal acts, such as Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) or the changes proposed in parallel to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. Finally, the amendments proposed better align the current regulatory framework to international developments in order to promote consistency and comparability among jurisdictions.\n(3) Financial holding companies and mixed financial holding companies can be parent undertakings of banking groups and the application of prudential requirements is required on the basis of the consolidated situation of such holding companies. As the institution controlled by such holding companies is not always able to ensure compliance with the requirements on a consolidated basis throughout the group, it is necessary that certain financial holding companies and mixed financial holding companies be brought under the direct scope of supervisory powers pursuant to Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 to ensure compliance on a consolidated basis. Therefore, a specific approval procedure and direct supervisory powers over certain financial holding companies and mixed financial holding companies should be provided for in order to ensure that such holding companies can be held directly responsible for ensuring compliance with consolidated prudential requirements, without subjecting them to additional prudential requirements on an individual basis.\n(4) The approval and supervision of certain financial holding companies and mixed financial holding companies should not prevent groups from deciding on the specific internal arrangements and distribution of tasks within the group as they see fit to ensure compliance with consolidated requirements, and should not prevent direct supervisory action on those institutions within the group that are engaged in ensuring compliance with prudential requirements on a consolidated basis.\n(5) Under specific circumstances, a financial holding company or mixed financial holding company that was set up for the purpose of holding participations in undertakings might be exempted from approval. Although it is recognised that an exempted financial holding company or mixed financial holding company might take decisions in the ordinary course of its business, it should not take management, operational or financial decisions affecting the group or those subsidiaries in the group that are institutions or financial institutions. When assessing compliance with that requirement, the competent authorities should take into account the relevant requirements under corporate law to which the financial holding company or mixed financial holding company is subject.\n(6) The consolidating supervisor is entrusted with the main responsibilities as regards supervision on a consolidated basis. Therefore, it is necessary that the consolidating supervisor be appropriately involved in the approval and supervision of financial holding companies and mixed financial holding companies. Where the consolidating supervisor differs from the competent authority in the Member State where the financial holding company or the mixed financial holding company is established, approval should be granted through a joint decision of those two authorities. The European Central Bank, when performing its task to carry out supervision on a consolidated basis over credit institutions' parents pursuant to Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 (7), should also exercise its duties in relation to the approval and supervision of financial holding companies and mixed financial holding companies.\n(7) The Commission's report of 28 July 2016 on the assessment of the remuneration rules under Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (the \u2018Commission's report of 28 July 2016\u2019) revealed that, when applied to small institutions, some of the principles set out in Directive 2013/36/EU, namely the requirements on deferral and pay-out in instruments, are too burdensome and not commensurate with their prudential benefits. Similarly, it found that the cost of applying those requirements exceeds their prudential benefits in the case of staff with low levels of variable remuneration, since such levels of variable remuneration produce little or no incentive for staff to take excessive risk. Consequently, while all institutions should in general be required to apply all the principles to all of their staff whose professional activities have a material impact on the institution's risk profile, it is necessary to exempt small institutions and staff with low levels of variable remuneration from the principles on deferral and pay-out in instruments set out in Directive 2013/36/EU.\n(8) Clear, consistent and harmonised criteria for identifying those small institutions as well as low levels of variable remuneration are necessary to ensure supervisory convergence and to foster a level playing field for institutions and the adequate protection of depositors, investors and consumers across the Union. At the same time, it is appropriate to offer some flexibility for Member States to adopt a stricter approach where they consider it necessary.\n(9) The principle of equal pay for male and female workers for equal work or work of equal value is laid down in Article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). That principle needs to be applied in a consistent manner by institutions. Therefore, they should operate a gender neutral remuneration policy.\n(10) The purpose of the remuneration requirements is to promote sound and effective risk management of institutions by aligning the long-term interests of both institutions and their staff whose professional activities have a material impact on the institution's risk profile (material risk takers). At the same time, subsidiaries which are not institutions, and therefore not subject to Directive 2013/36/EU on an individual basis, might be subject to other remuneration requirements pursuant to the relevant sector-specific legal acts which should prevail. Therefore, as a rule, remuneration requirements set out in this Directive should not apply on a consolidated basis to such subsidiaries. However, to prevent possible arbitrage, the remuneration requirements set out in this Directive should apply on a consolidated basis to staff that are employed in subsidiaries that provide specific services, such as asset management, portfolio management or execution of orders, whereby such staff is mandated, regardless of the form such mandate might take, to perform professional activities which qualify them as material risk takers at the level of the banking group. Such mandates should include delegation or outsourcing arrangements concluded between the subsidiary employing the staff and another institution in the same group. Member States should not be prevented from applying the remuneration requirements set out in this Directive on a consolidated basis to a broader set of subsidiary undertakings and their staff.\n(11) Directive 2013/36/EU requires that a substantial portion, and in any event at least 50 %, of any variable remuneration, consist of a balance of shares or equivalent ownership interests, subject to the legal structure of the institution concerned, or share-linked instruments or equivalent non-cash instruments, in the case of a non-listed institution; and, where possible, of alternative Tier 1 or Tier 2 instruments which meet certain conditions. That principle limits the use of share-linked instruments to non-listed institutions and requires listed institutions to use shares. The Commission's report of 28 July 2016 found that the use of shares can lead to considerable administrative burdens and costs for listed institutions. At the same time, equivalent prudential benefits can be achieved by allowing listed institutions to use share-linked instruments that track the value of shares. The possibility of using share-linked instruments should therefore be extended to listed institutions.\n(12) The supervisory review and evaluation should take into account the size, the structure and the internal organisation of institutions and the nature, scope and complexity of their activities. Where different institutions have similar risk profiles, for instance because they have similar business models or geographical location of exposures or they are affiliated to the same institutional protection scheme, competent authorities should be able to tailor the methodology for the review and evaluation process to capture the common characteristics and risks of institutions with such same risk profile. Such tailoring should, however, neither prevent competent authorities from duly taking into account the specific risks affecting each institution nor alter the institution-specific nature of the measures imposed.\n(13) The additional own funds requirement imposed by competent authorities is an important driver of an institution's overall level of own funds and is relevant for market participants since the level of additional own funds requirement imposed impacts the trigger point for restrictions on dividend payments, bonus pay-outs and the payments on Additional Tier 1 instruments. A clear definition of the conditions under which the additional own funds requirement is to be imposed should be provided to ensure that rules are consistently applied across Member States and to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market.\n(14) The additional own funds requirement to be imposed by competent authorities should be set in relation to the specific situation of an institution and should be duly justified. Additional own funds requirements can be imposed to address risks or elements of risk explicitly excluded or not explicitly covered by the own funds requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 only to the extent that this is considered necessary in light of the specific situation of an institution. Those requirements should be positioned in the relevant stacking order of own funds requirements above the relevant minimum own funds requirements and below the combined buffer requirement or the leverage ratio buffer requirement, as relevant. The institution-specific nature of additional own funds requirements should prevent their use as a tool to address macroprudential or systemic risks. However, that should not preclude competent authorities from addressing, including by means of additional own funds requirements, the risks incurred by individual institutions due to their activities, including those reflecting the impact of certain economic and market developments on the risk profile of an individual institution.\n(15) The leverage ratio requirement is a parallel requirement to the risk-based own funds requirements. Therefore, any additional own funds requirements imposed by competent authorities to address the risk of excessive leverage should be added to the minimum leverage ratio requirement and not to the minimum risk-based own funds requirement. Furthermore, institutions should also be able to use any Common Equity Tier 1 capital that they use to meet their leverage-related requirements to meet their risk-based own funds requirements, including the combined buffer requirement.\n(16) It should be possible for competent authorities to communicate to an institution in the form of guidance any adjustment to the amount of capital in excess of the relevant minimum own funds requirements, the relevant additional own funds requirement and, as relevant, the combined buffer requirement or the leverage ratio buffer requirement that they expect such an institution to hold in order to deal with forward looking stress scenarios. Since such guidance constitutes a capital target, it should be regarded as positioned above the relevant minimum own funds requirements, the relevant additional own funds requirement and the combined buffer requirement or leverage buffer requirement, as relevant. The failure to meet such a target should not trigger the restrictions on distributions provided for in Directive 2013/36/EU. Given that the guidance on additional own funds reflects supervisory expectations, Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 should neither set out mandatory disclosure obligations for the guidance nor prohibit competent authorities from requesting disclosure of the guidance. Where an institution repeatedly fails to meet the capital target, the competent authority should be entitled to take supervisory measures and, where appropriate, to impose additional own funds requirements.\n(17) The provisions of Directive 2013/36/EU on interest rate risk arising from non-trading book activities are linked to the relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 which require a longer implementation period for institutions. In order to align the application of provisions on interest rate risk arising from non-trading book activities, the provisions necessary to comply with the relevant provisions of this Directive should apply from the same date as the relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.\n(18) In order to harmonise the calculation of the interest rate risk arising from non-trading book activities when the institutions' internal systems for measuring that risk are not satisfactory, the Commission should be empowered to adopt regulatory technical standards developed by the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority) (EBA), established by Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8) in respect of developing a standardised methodology for the purpose of evaluating such risk. The Commission should adopt those regulatory technical standards by means of delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 TFEU and in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.\n(19) In order to improve the competent authorities' identification of those institutions which might be subject to excessive losses in their non-trading book activities as a result of potential changes in interest rates, the Commission should be empowered to adopt regulatory technical standards developed by EBA. Those regulatory technical standards should specify: the six supervisory shock scenarios that all institutions have to apply in order to calculate changes in the economic value of equity; the common assumptions that institutions have to implement in their internal systems for the purpose of calculating the economic value of equity, and in respect of determining the potential need for specific criteria to identify the institutions for which supervisory measures might be warranted following a decrease in the net interest income attributed to changes in interest rates; and what constitutes a large decline. The Commission should adopt those regulatory technical standards by means of delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 TFEU and in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.\n(20) Combating money laundering and terrorist financing is essential for maintaining stability and integrity in the financial system. Uncovering involvement of an institution in money laundering and terrorist financing might have an impact on its viability and the stability of the financial system. Together with the authorities and bodies responsible for ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering rules under Directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9), the competent authorities in charge of authorisation and prudential supervision have an important role to play in identifying and disciplining weaknesses. Therefore, such competent authorities should consistently factor money laundering and terrorist financing concerns into their relevant supervisory activities, including supervisory evaluation and review processes, assessments of the adequacy of institutions' governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms and assessments of the suitability of members of the management body, inform accordingly on any findings the relevant authorities and bodies responsible for ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering rules and take, as appropriate, supervisory measures in accordance with their powers under Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. Information should be provided on the basis of findings revealed in the authorisation, approval or review processes such competent authorities are in charge of, as well as on the basis of information received from the authorities and bodies responsible for ensuring compliance with Directive (EU) 2015/849.\n(21) One of the key lessons from the financial crisis in the Union was the need to have an adequate institutional and policy framework to prevent and address imbalances within the Union. In light of the latest institutional developments in the Union, a comprehensive review of the macroprudential policy framework is warranted.\n(22) Directive 2013/36/EU should not preclude Member States from implementing measures in national law designed to enhance the resilience of the financial system such as, but not limited to, loan-to-value limits, debt-to-income limits, debt-service-to-income limits and other instruments addressing lending standards.\n(23) In order to ensure that countercyclical capital buffers properly reflect the risk to the banking sector of excessive credit growth, institutions should calculate their institution-specific buffers as a weighted average of the countercyclical buffer rates that apply in the countries where their credit exposures are located. Every Member State should therefore designate an authority responsible for the setting of the countercyclical buffer rate for exposures located in that Member State. That buffer rate should take into account the growth of credit levels and changes to the ratio of credit to gross domestic product (GDP) in that Member State, and any other variables relevant to the risks to the stability of the financial system.\n(24) In addition to a capital conservation buffer and a countercyclical capital buffer, Member States should be able to require certain institutions to hold a systemic risk buffer in order to prevent and mitigate macroprudential or systemic risks not covered by Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and by Directive 2013/36/EU, namely a risk of disruption to the financial system with the potential for serious negative consequences for the financial system and the real economy in a specific Member State. The systemic risk buffer rate should apply to all exposures or to a subset of exposures and to all institutions, or to one or more subsets of those institutions, where the institutions exhibit similar risk profiles in their business activities.\n(25) It is important to streamline the coordination mechanism between authorities, ensure a clear delineation of responsibilities, simplify the activation of macroprudential policy tools and broaden the macroprudential toolbox to ensure that authorities are enabled to address systemic risks in a timely and effective manner. The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) established by Regulation (EU) No 1092/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10) is expected to play a key role in the coordination of macroprudential measures, as well as the transmission of information on planned macroprudential measures in Member States, in particular through the publication of adopted macroprudential measures on its website and through information sharing across authorities following the notifications of planned macroprudential measures. In order to ensure appropriate policy responses among Member States, the ESRB is expected to monitor the sufficiency and consistency of Member States' macroprudential policies, including by monitoring whether tools are used in a consistent and non-overlapping manner.\n(26) The relevant competent or designated authorities should aim at avoiding any duplicative or inconsistent use of the macroprudential measures laid down in Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. In particular, the relevant competent or designated authorities should duly consider whether measures taken under Article 133 of Directive 2013/36/EU duplicate or are inconsistent with other existing or upcoming measures under Article 124, 164 or 458 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.\n(27) Competent or designated authorities should be able to determine the level or levels of application of the other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs) buffer, on the basis of the nature and distribution of the risks embedded in the structure of the group. In some circumstances, it might be appropriate for the competent authority or the designated authority to impose an O-SII buffer solely at a level below the highest level of consolidation.\n(28) In accordance with the assessment methodology for global systemically important banks published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), the cross-jurisdictional claims and liabilities of an institution are indicators of its global systemic importance and of the impact that its failure can have on the global financial system. Those indicators reflect the specific concerns, for instance, about the greater difficulty in coordinating the resolution of institutions with significant cross-border activities. The progress made in terms of the common approach to resolution resulting from the reinforcement of the single rulebook and from the establishment of the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) has significantly developed the ability to orderly resolve cross-border groups within the banking union. Therefore, and without prejudice to the capacity of competent or designated authorities to exercise their supervisory judgment, an alternative score reflecting that progress should be calculated and competent or designated authorities should take that score into consideration when assessing the systemic importance of credit institutions, without affecting the data supplied to the BCBS for the determination of international denominators. EBA should develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the additional identification methodology for global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs) to allow the recognition of the specificities of the integrated European resolution framework within the context of the SRM. That methodology should be used solely for the purposes of the calibration of the G-SII buffer. The Commission should adopt those regulatory technical standards by means of delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 TFEU and in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.\n(29) Since the objectives of this Directive, namely to reinforce and refine already existing Union legal acts ensuring uniform prudential requirements that apply to institutions throughout the Union, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of their scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(30) In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of 28 September 2011 of Member States and the Commission on explanatory documents (11), Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments. With regard to this Directive, the legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be justified.\n(31) Directive 2013/36/EU should therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:",

In that case, the assessment period referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 22(3) shall be suspended for a period exceeding 20 working days until the procedure set out in this Article is complete. 3.   Approval may be granted to a financial holding company or mixed financial holding company pursuant to this Article only where all of the following conditions are fulfilled:\n(a) the internal arrangements and distribution of tasks within the group are adequate for the purpose of complying with the requirements imposed by this Directive and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 on a consolidated or sub-consolidated basis and, in particular, are effective to:\n(i) coordinate all the subsidiaries of the financial holding company or mixed financial holding company including, where necessary, through an adequate distribution of tasks among subsidiary institutions;\n(ii) prevent or manage intra-group conflicts; and\n(iii) enforce the group-wide policies set by the parent financial holding company or parent mixed financial holding company throughout the group;\n(b) the structural organisation of the group of which the financial holding company or mixed financial holding company is part does not obstruct or otherwise prevent the effective supervision of the subsidiary institutions or parent institutions as concerns the individual, consolidated and, where appropriate, sub-consolidated obligations to which they are subject.

Where the consolidating supervisor has established that the conditions set out in paragraph 3 are not met or have ceased to be met, the financial holding company or mixed financial holding company shall be subject to appropriate supervisory measures to ensure or restore, as the case may be, continuity and integrity of consolidated supervision and ensuring compliance with the requirements laid down in this Directive and in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 on a consolidated basis. In the case of a mixed financial holding company, the supervisory measures shall, in particular, take into account the effects on the financial conglomerate.\nThe supervisory measures referred to in the first subparagraph may include:\n(a) suspending the exercise of voting rights attached to the shares of the subsidiary institutions held by the financial holding company or mixed financial holding company;\n(b) issuing injunctions or penalties against the financial holding company, the mixed financial holding company or the members of the management body and managers, subject to Articles 65 to 72;\n(c) giving instructions or directions to the financial holding company or mixed financial holding company to transfer to its shareholders the participations in its subsidiary institutions;\n(d) designating on a temporary basis another financial holding company, mixed financial holding company or institution within the group as responsible for ensuring compliance with the requirements laid down in this Directive and in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 on a consolidated basis;\n(e) restricting or prohibiting distributions or interest payments to shareholders;\n(f) requiring financial holding companies or mixed financial holding companies to divest from or reduce holdings in institutions or other financial sector entities;\n(g) requiring financial holding companies or mixed financial holding companies to submit a plan on return, without delay, to compliance. 7.

The consolidating supervisor shall prepare an assessment on the matters referred to in paragraphs 3, 4, 6 and 7, as applicable, and shall forward that assessment to the competent authority in the Member State where the financial holding company or the mixed financial holding company is established. The two authorities shall do everything within their powers to reach a joint decision within two months of receipt of that assessment.\nThe joint decision shall be duly documented and reasoned.

In the case of mixed financial holding companies, where the consolidating supervisor or the competent authority in the Member State where the mixed financial holding company is established is different from the coordinator determined in accordance with Article 10 of Directive 2002/87/EC, the agreement of the coordinator shall be required for the purposes of decisions or joint decisions referred to in paragraphs 3, 4, 6 and 7 of this Article, as applicable. Where the agreement of the coordinator is required, disagreements shall be referred to the relevant European Supervisory Authority, namely, EBA or the European Supervisory Authority (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority) (EIOPA), established by Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (*3), which shall take its decision within one month of receipt of the referral. Any decision taken in accordance with this paragraph shall be without prejudice to the obligations under Directive 2002/87/EC or 2009/138/EC. 10.   Where approval of a financial holding company or mixed financial holding company pursuant to this Article is refused, the consolidating supervisor shall notify the applicant of the decision and the reasons therefor within four months of receipt of the application, or where the application is incomplete, within four months of receipt of the complete information required for the decision.\nA decision to grant or refuse approval shall, in any event, be taken within six months of receipt of the application.

Two or more institutions in the Union, which are part of the same third-country group, shall have a single intermediate EU parent undertaking that is established in the Union. 2.   Competent authorities may allow the institutions referred to in paragraph 1 to have two intermediate EU parent undertakings where they determine that the establishment of a single intermediate EU parent undertaking would:\n(a) be incompatible with a mandatory requirement for separation of activities imposed by the rules or supervisory authorities of the third country where the ultimate parent undertaking of the third-country group has its head office; or\n(b) render resolvability less efficient than in the case of two intermediate EU parent undertakings according to an assessment carried out by the competent resolution authority of the intermediate EU parent undertaking. 3.   An intermediate EU parent undertaking shall be a credit institution authorised in accordance with Article 8, or a financial holding company or mixed financial holding company that has been granted approval in accordance with Article 21a.\nBy way of derogation from the first subparagraph of this paragraph, where none of the institutions referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article is a credit institution or where a second intermediate EU parent undertaking must be set up in connection with investment activities to comply with a mandatory requirement as referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, the intermediate EU parent undertaking or the second intermediate EU parent undertaking, may be an investment firm authorised in accordance with Article 5(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU that is subject to Directive 2014/59/EU. 4.   Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply where the total value of assets in the Union of the third-country group is less than EUR 40 billion. 5.   For the purposes of this Article, the total value of assets in the Union of the third-country group shall be the sum of the following:\n(a) the total value of assets of each institution in the Union of the third country-group, as resulting from its consolidated balance sheet or as resulting from their individual balance sheet, where an institution's balance sheet is not consolidated; and\n(b) the total value of assets of each branch of the third-country group authorised in the Union in accordance with this Directive, Directive 2014/65/EU or Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (*4). 6.   Competent authorities shall notify the following information in respect of each third-country group operating in their jurisdiction to EBA:\n(a) the names and the total value of assets of supervised institutions belonging to a third-country group;\n(b) the names and the total value of assets corresponding to branches authorised in that Member State in accordance with this Directive, Directive 2014/65/EU or Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, and the types of activities that they are authorised to carry out;\n(c) the name and the type as referred to in paragraph 3 of any intermediate EU parent undertaking set up in that Member State and the name of the third-country group of which it is part. 7.   EBA shall publish on its website a list of all third-country groups operating in the Union and their intermediate EU parent undertaking or undertakings, where applicable.\nCompetent authorities shall ensure that each institution under their jurisdiction that is part of a third-country group meets one of the following conditions:\n(a) it has an intermediate EU parent undertaking;\n(b) it is an intermediate EU parent undertaking;\n(c) it is the only institution in the Union of the third-country group; or\n(d) it is part of a third-country group with a total value of assets in the Union of less than EUR 40 billion. 8.

By 30 December 2026 the Commission shall, after consulting EBA, review the requirements imposed on institutions by this Article and submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council. That report shall, at least, consider:\n(a) whether the requirements laid down in this Article are operable, necessary and proportionate and whether other measures would be more appropriate;\n(b) whether the requirements imposed on institutions by this Article should be revised to reflect best international practices. 10.   By 28 June 2021, EBA shall submit a report to the European Parliament, to the Council and to the Commission on the treatment of third-country branches under national law of Member States.

For the purposes of Article 97, Article 98(4) and (5), Article 101(4) and Article 102 of this Directive and of the application of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, competent authorities shall have at least the power to:\n(a) require institutions to have additional own funds in excess of the requirements set out in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, under the conditions set out in Article 104a of this Directive;\n(b) require the reinforcement of the arrangements, processes, mechanisms and strategies implemented in accordance with Articles 73 and 74;\n(c) require institutions to submit a plan to restore compliance with supervisory requirements pursuant to this Directive and to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and set a deadline for its implementation, including improvements to that plan regarding scope and deadline;\n(d) require institutions to apply a specific provisioning policy or treatment of assets in terms of own funds requirements;\n(e) restrict or limit the business, operations or network of institutions or to request the divestment of activities that pose excessive risks to the soundness of an institution;\n(f) require the reduction of the risk inherent in the activities, products and systems of institutions, including outsourced activities;\n(g) require institutions to limit variable remuneration as a percentage of net revenues where it is inconsistent with the maintenance of a sound capital base;\n(h) require institutions to use net profits to strengthen own funds;\n(i) restrict or prohibit distributions or interest payments by an institution to shareholders, members or holders of Additional Tier 1 instruments where the prohibition does not constitute an event of default of the institution;\n(j) impose additional or more frequent reporting requirements, including reporting on own funds, liquidity and leverage;\n(k) impose specific liquidity requirements, including restrictions on maturity mismatches between assets and liabilities;\n(l) require additional disclosures. 2.   For the purposes of point (j) of paragraph 1, competent authorities may only impose additional or more frequent reporting requirements on institutions where the relevant requirement is appropriate and proportionate with regard to the purpose for which the information is required and the information requested is not duplicative.\nFor the purposes of Articles 97 to 102, any additional information that may be required from institutions shall be deemed as duplicative where the same or substantially the same information has already been otherwise reported to the competent authority or may be produced by the competent authority.\nThe competent authority shall not require an institution to report additional information where it has previously received it in a different format or level of granularity and that different format or granularity does not prevent the competent authority from producing information of the same quality and reliability as that produced on the basis of the additional information that would be otherwise reported.\u2019;\n(b) paragraph 3 is deleted;\n(33) the following articles are inserted:\n\u2018Article 104a\nAdditional own funds requirement 1.   Competent authorities shall impose the additional own funds requirement referred to in point (a) of Article 104(1) where, on the basis of the reviews carried out in accordance with Articles 97 and 101, they determine any of the following situations for an individual institution:\n(a) the institution is exposed to risks or elements of risk that are not covered or not sufficiently covered, as specified in paragraph 2 of this Article, by the own funds requirements set out in Parts Three, Four and Seven of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and in Chapter 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 of the European Parliament and of the Council (*7);\n(b) the institution does not meet the requirements set out in Articles 73 and 74 of this Directive or in Article 393 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and it is unlikely that other supervisory measures would be sufficient to ensure that those requirements can be met within an appropriate timeframe;\n(c) the adjustments referred to in Article 98(4) are deemed to be insufficient to enable the institution to sell or hedge out its positions within a short period without incurring material losses under normal market conditions;\n(d) the evaluation carried out in accordance with Article 101(4) reveals that the non-compliance with the requirements for the application of the permitted approach will likely lead to inadequate own funds requirements;\n(e) the institution repeatedly fails to establish or maintain an adequate level of additional own funds to cover the guidance communicated in accordance with Article 104b(3);\n(f) other institution-specific situations deemed by the competent authority to raise material supervisory concerns.\nThe competent authorities shall only impose the additional own funds requirement referred to in point (a) of Article 104(1) to cover the risks incurred by individual institutions due to their activities, including those reflecting the impact of certain economic and market developments on the risk profile of an individual institution. 2.   For the purposes of point (a) of paragraph 1 of this Article, risks or elements of risk shall only be considered as not covered or not sufficiently covered by the own funds requirements set out in Parts Three, Four and Seven of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and in Chapter 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 where the amounts, types and distribution of capital considered adequate by the competent authority, taking into account the supervisory review of the assessment carried out by institutions in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 73 of this Directive, are higher than the own funds requirements set out in Parts Three, Four and Seven of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and in Chapter 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402. For the purposes of the first subparagraph, competent authorities shall assess, taking into account the risk profile of each individual institution, the risks to which the institution is exposed, including:\n(a) institution-specific risks or elements of such risks that are explicitly excluded from or not explicitly addressed by the own funds requirements set out in Parts Three, Four and Seven of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and in Chapter 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402;\n(b) institution-specific risks or elements of such risks likely to be underestimated despite compliance with the applicable requirements set out in Parts Three, Four and Seven of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and in Chapter 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402. To the extent that risks or elements of risk are subject to transitional arrangements or grandfathering provisions laid down in this Directive or in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, they shall not be considered risks or elements of such risks likely to be underestimated despite compliance with the applicable requirements set out in Parts Three, Four and Seven of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and in Chapter 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402. For the purposes of the first subparagraph, the capital considered adequate shall cover all risks or elements of risks identified as material pursuant to the assessment laid down in the second subparagraph of this paragraph that are not covered or not sufficiently covered by the own funds requirements set out in Parts Three, Four and Seven of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and in Chapter 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402. Interest rate risk arising from non-trading book positions may be considered material at least in the cases referred to in Article 98(5), unless the competent authorities, in performing the review and evaluation, come to the conclusion that the institution's management of interest rate risk arising from non-trading book activities is adequate and that the institution is not excessively exposed to interest rate risk arising from non-trading book activities. 3.   Where additional own funds are required to address risks other than the risk of excessive leverage not sufficiently covered by point (d) of Article 92(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, competent authorities shall determine the level of the additional own funds required under point (a) of paragraph 1 of this Article as the difference between the capital considered adequate pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article and the relevant own funds requirements set out in Parts Three and Four of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and in Chapter 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402. Where additional own funds are required to address the risk of excessive leverage not sufficiently covered by point (d) of Article 92(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, competent authorities shall determine the level of the additional own funds required under point (a) of paragraph 1 of this Article as the difference between the capital considered adequate pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article and the relevant own funds requirements set out in Parts Three and Seven of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. 4.   The institution shall meet the additional own funds requirement imposed by the competent authority under point (a) of Article 104(1) with own funds that satisfy the following conditions:\n(a) at least three quarters of the additional own funds requirement shall be met with Tier 1 capital;\n(b) at least three quarters of the Tier 1 capital referred to in point (a) shall be composed of Common Equity Tier 1 capital.\nBy way of derogation from the first subparagraph, the competent authority may require the institution to meet its additional own funds requirement with a higher portion of Tier 1 capital or Common Equity Tier 1 capital, where necessary, and having regard to the specific circumstances of the institution.\nOwn funds that are used to meet the additional own funds requirement referred to in point (a) of Article 104(1) of this Directive imposed by competent authorities to address risks other than the risk of excessive leverage shall not be used to meet any of the following:\n(a) own funds requirements set out in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 92(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;\n(b) the combined buffer requirement;\n(c) the guidance on additional own funds referred to in Article 104b(3) of this Directive where that guidance addresses risks other than the risk of excessive leverage.\nOwn funds that are used to meet the additional own funds requirement referred to in point (a) of Article 104(1) of this Directive imposed by competent authorities to address the risk of excessive leverage not sufficiently covered by point (d) of Article 92(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 shall not be used to meet any of the following:\n(a) the own funds requirement set out in point (d) of Article 92(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;\n(b) the leverage ratio buffer requirement referred to in Article 92(1a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;\n(c) the guidance on additional own funds referred to in Article 104b(3) of this Directive, where that guidance addresses risks of excessive leverage. 5.   The competent authority shall duly justify in writing to each institution the decision to impose an additional own funds requirement under point (a) of Article 104(1), at least by giving a clear account of the full assessment of the elements referred to in paragraphs 1 to 4 of this Article. That justification shall include, in the case set out in point (e) of paragraph 1 of this Article, a specific statement of the reasons for which the imposition of guidance on additional own funds is no longer considered sufficient.\nArticle 104b\nGuidance on additional own funds 1.   Pursuant to the strategies and processes referred to in Article 73, institutions shall set their internal capital at an adequate level of own funds that is sufficient to cover all the risks that an institution is exposed to and to ensure that the institution's own funds can absorb potential losses resulting from stress scenarios, including those identified under the supervisory stress test referred to in Article 100. 2.   Competent authorities shall regularly review the level of the internal capital set by each institution in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article as part of the reviews and evaluations performed in accordance with Articles 97 and 101, including the results of the stress tests referred to in Article 100. Pursuant to that review, competent authorities shall determine for each institution the overall level of own funds they consider appropriate. 3.   Competent authorities shall communicate their guidance on additional own funds, to institutions.\nThe guidance on additional own funds shall be the own funds exceeding the relevant amount of own funds required pursuant to Parts Three, Four and Seven of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, Chapter 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402, point (a) of Article 104(1) and point (6) of Article 128 of this Directive or pursuant to Article 92(1a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, as relevant, which are needed to reach the overall level of own funds considered appropriate by the competent authorities pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article. 4.   Competent authorities' guidance on additional own funds pursuant to paragraph 3 of this Article shall be institution-specific. The guidance may cover risks addressed by the additional own funds requirement imposed pursuant to point (a) of Article 104(1) only to the extent that it covers aspects of those risks that are not already covered under that requirement. 5.   Own funds that are used to meet the guidance on additional own funds communicated in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article to address risks other than the risk of excessive leverage shall not be used to meet any of the following:\n(a) the own funds requirements set out in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 92(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;\n(b) the requirement laid down in Article 104a of this Directive imposed by competent authorities to address risks other than the risk of excessive leverage and the combined buffer requirement.\nOwn funds that are used to meet the guidance on additional own funds communicated in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article to address the risk of excessive leverage shall not be used to meet the own funds requirement set out in point (d) of Article 92(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the requirement laid down in Article 104a of this Directive imposed by competent authorities to address the risk of excessive leverage and the leverage ratio buffer requirement referred to in Article 92(1a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. 6.   Failure to meet the guidance referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article where an institution meets the relevant own funds requirements set out in Parts Three, Four and Seven of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and in Chapter 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402, the relevant additional own funds requirement referred to in point (a) of Article 104(1) of this Directive and, as relevant, the combined buffer requirement or the leverage ratio buffer requirement referred to in Article 92(1a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 shall not trigger the restrictions referred to in Article 141 or 141b of this Directive.\nArticle 104c\nCooperation with resolution authorities\nCompetent authorities shall notify the relevant resolution authorities of the additional own funds requirement imposed on institutions pursuant to point (a) of Article 104(1) and of any guidance on additional own funds communicated to institutions in accordance with Article 104b(3).\n(*7)  Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2017 laying down a general framework for securitisation and creating a specific framework for simple, transparent and standardised securitisation, and amending Directives 2009/65/EC, 2009/138/EC and 2011/61/EU and Regulations (EC) No 1060/2009 and (EU) No 648/2012 (OJ L 347, 28.12.2017, p. 35).\u2019;\"\n                        \n(34) in Article 105, point (d) is deleted;\n(35) in Article 108, paragraph 3 is deleted;\n(36) Article 109 is amended as follows:\n(a) paragraphs 2 and 3 are replaced by the following:\n\u20182.

In particular, they shall ensure that parent undertakings and subsidiaries subject to this Directive implement those arrangements, processes and mechanisms in their subsidiaries not subject to this Directive, including those established in offshore financial centres. Those arrangements, processes and mechanisms shall also be consistent and well-integrated and those subsidiaries shall also be able to produce any data and information relevant to the purpose of supervision. Subsidiary undertakings that are not themselves subject to this Directive shall comply with their sector-specific requirements on an individual basis. 3.   Obligations resulting from Section II of this Chapter concerning subsidiary undertakings that are not themselves subject to this Directive shall not apply if the EU parent institution can demonstrate to the competent authorities that the application of Section II is unlawful under the laws of the third country where the subsidiary is established.\u2019;\n(b) the following paragraphs are added:\n\u20184.

By way of derogation from the third subparagraph of paragraph 1, from point (b) of paragraph 3 and from paragraph 4, where a competent authority supervises on an individual basis more than one credit institution within a group, the consolidating supervisor shall be the competent authority that supervises on an individual basis one or more credit institutions within the group where the sum of the balance sheet totals of those supervised credit institutions is higher than that of the credit institutions supervised on an individual basis by any other competent authority.\nBy way of derogation from point (c) of paragraph 3, where a competent authority supervises on an individual basis more than one investment firm within a group, the consolidating supervisor shall be the competent authority that supervises on an individual basis one or more investment firms within the group with the highest balance sheet total in aggregate. 6.   In particular cases, the competent authorities may waive by common agreement the criteria referred to in paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 and appoint a different competent authority to exercise supervision on a consolidated basis where the application of the criteria referred to therein would be inappropriate, taking into account the institutions concerned and the relative importance of their activities in the relevant Member States, or the need to ensure the continuity of supervision on a consolidated basis by the same competent authority.

That buffer shall consist of Common Equity Tier 1 capital.\u2019;\n(e) the following paragraph is inserted:\n\u20185a.   Subject to the Commission authorisation referred to in the third subparagraph of this paragraph, the competent authority or the designated authority may require each O-SII, on a consolidated, sub-consolidated or individual basis, as applicable, to maintain an O-SII buffer higher than 3 % of the total risk exposure amount calculated in accordance with Article 92(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. That buffer shall consist of Common Equity Tier 1 capital.\nWithin six weeks of receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 7 of this Article, the ESRB shall provide the Commission with an opinion as to whether the O-SII buffer is deemed appropriate. EBA may also provide the Commission with its opinion on the buffer in accordance with Article 34(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. Within three months of the ESRB forwarding the notification referred to in paragraph 7 to the Commission, the Commission, taking into account the assessment of the ESRB and EBA, if relevant, and if it is satisfied that the O-SII buffer does not entail disproportionate adverse effects on the whole or parts of the financial system of other Member States or of the Union as a whole forming or creating an obstacle to the proper functioning of the internal market, shall adopt an act authorising the competent authority or the designated authority to adopt the proposed measure.\u2019;\n(f) in paragraph 7, the introductory part is replaced by the following:\n\u20187.   Before setting or resetting an O-SII buffer, the competent authority or the designated authority shall notify the ESRB one month before the publication of the decision referred to in paragraph 5 and shall notify the ESRB three months before the publication of the decision of the competent authority or the designated authority referred to in paragraph 5a. The ESRB shall forward such notifications to the Commission, to EBA and to the competent and designated authorities of the Member States concerned without delay. Such notifications shall set out in detail:\u2019;\n(g) paragraph 8 is replaced by the following:\n\u20188.   Without prejudice to Article 133 and paragraph 5 of this Article, where an O-SII is a subsidiary of either a G-SII or an O-SII which is either an institution or a group headed by an EU parent institution, and subject to an O-SII buffer on a consolidated basis, the buffer that applies on an individual or sub-consolidated basis for the O-SII shall not exceed the lower of:\n(a) the sum of the higher of the G-SII or the O-SII buffer rate applicable to the group on a consolidated basis and 1 % of the total risk exposure amount calculated in accordance with Article 92(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; and\n(b) 3 % of the total risk exposure amount calculated in accordance with Article 92(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, or the rate the Commission has authorised to be applied to the group on a consolidated basis in accordance with paragraph 5a of this Article.\u2019;\n(h) paragraphs 9 and 10 are replaced by the following:\n\u20189.   There shall be at least five sub-categories of G-SIIs. The lowest boundary and the boundaries between each subcategory shall be determined by the scores in accordance with the identification methodology referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article. The cut-off scores between adjacent sub-categories shall be defined clearly and shall adhere to the principle that there is a constant linear increase of systemic significance, between each sub-category resulting in a linear increase in the requirement of additional Common Equity Tier 1 capital, with the exception of sub-category five and any added higher sub-category. For the purposes of this paragraph, systemic significance is the expected impact exerted by the G-SII's distress on the global financial market. The lowest sub-category shall be assigned a G-SII buffer of 1 % of the total risk exposure amount calculated in accordance with Article 92(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and the buffer assigned to each sub-category shall increase in gradients of at least 0,5 % of the total risk exposure amount calculated in accordance with Article 92(3) of that Regulation. 10.   Without prejudice to paragraphs 1 and 9 and using the sub-categories and cut-off scores referred to in paragraph 9, the competent authority or the designated authority may, in the exercise of sound supervisory judgment:\n(a) re-allocate a G-SII from a lower sub-category to a higher sub-category;\n(b) allocate an entity as referred to in paragraph 1 that has an overall score as referred to in paragraph 2 that is lower than the cut-off score of the lowest sub-category to that sub-category or to a higher sub-category, thereby designating it as a G-SII;\n(c) taking into account the Single Resolution Mechanism, on the basis of the additional overall score referred to in paragraph 2a re-allocate a G-SII from a higher sub-category to a lower sub-category.\u2019;\n(i) paragraph 11 is deleted;\n(j) paragraph 12 is replaced by the following:\n\u201812.

The ESRB shall forward such notifications to the Commission and to EBA without delay, and shall publicly disclose their names. The competent authorities or designated authorities shall publicly disclose the sub-category to which each G-SII is allocated.\nThe competent authority or the designated authority shall review annually the identification of G-SIIs and O-SIIs and the G-SII allocation into the respective sub-categories and report the result to the systemically important institution concerned, to the ESRB which shall forward the results to the Commission and to EBA without delay. The competent authority or the designated authority shall publicly disclose the updated list of identified systemically important institutions and the sub-category into which each identified G-SII is allocated.\u2019;\n(k) paragraph 13 is deleted;\n(l) paragraphs 14 and 15 are replaced by the following:\n\u201814.   Where a group, on a consolidated basis, is subject to a G-SII buffer and to an O-SII buffer the higher buffer shall apply. 15.   Where an institution is subject to a systemic risk buffer, set in accordance with Article 133, that buffer shall be cumulative with the O-SII buffer or the G-SII buffer that is applied in accordance with this Article.\nWhere the sum of the systemic risk buffer rate as calculated for the purposes of paragraph 10, 11 or 12 of Article 133 and the O-SII buffer rate or the G-SII buffer rate to which the same institution is subject to would be higher than 5 %, the procedure set out in paragraph 5a of this Article shall apply.\u2019;\n(m) paragraphs 16 and 17 are deleted;\n(n) paragraph 18 is replaced by the following:\n\u201818.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify, for the purposes of this Article, the methodologies in accordance with which the competent authority or the designated authority shall identify an institution or a group headed by an EU parent institution, an EU parent financial holding company or by an EU parent mixed financial holding company as a G-SII and to specify the methodology for the definition of the sub-categories and the allocation of G-SIIs in the sub-categories based on their systemic significance, taking into account any internationally agreed standards.\nEBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 30 June 2014. Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.\u2019;\n(48) Article 132 is deleted;\n(49) Articles 133 and 134 are replaced by the following:\n\u2018Article 133\nRequirement to maintain a systemic risk buffer 1.   Each Member State may introduce a systemic risk buffer of Common Equity Tier 1 capital for the financial sector or one or more subsets of that sector on all or a subset of exposures as referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article, in order to prevent and mitigate macroprudential or systemic risks not covered by Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and by Articles 130 and 131 of this Directive, in the meaning of a risk of disruption in the financial system with the potential to have serious negative consequences to the financial system and the real economy in a specific Member State. 2.   Institutions shall calculate the systemic risk buffer as follows:\nwhere:\nBSR\n= the systemic risk buffer;\nrT\n= the buffer rate applicable to the total risk exposure amount of an institution;\nET\n= the total risk exposure amount of an institution calculated in accordance with Article 92(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;\ni= the index denoting the subset of exposures as referred to in paragraph 5;\nri\n= the buffer rate applicable to the risk exposure amount of the subset of exposures i; and\nEi\n= the risk exposure amount of an institution for the subset of exposures i calculated in accordance with Article 92(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. 3.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, Member States shall designate an authority to be responsible for setting the systemic risk buffer and for identifying the exposures and subsets of institutions to which it applies. That authority shall be either the competent authority or the designated authority. 4.   For the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article, the relevant competent or designated authority, as applicable, may require institutions to maintain a systemic risk buffer of Common Equity Tier 1 capital calculated in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article, on an individual, consolidated, or sub-consolidated basis, as applicable in accordance with Title II of Part One of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. 5.   A systemic risk buffer may apply to:\n(a) all exposures located in the Member State that sets that buffer;\n(b) the following sectoral exposures located in the Member State that sets that buffer:\n(i) all retail exposures to natural persons which are secured by residential property;\n(ii) all exposures to legal persons which are secured by mortgages on commercial immovable property;\n(iii) all exposures to legal persons excluding those specified in point (ii);\n(iv) all exposures to natural persons excluding those specified in point (i);\n(c) all exposures located in other Member States, subject to paragraphs 12 and 15;\n(d) sectoral exposures, as identified in point (b) of this paragraph, located in other Member States only to enable recognition of a buffer rate set by another Member State in accordance with Article 134;\n(e) exposures located in third countries;\n(f) subsets of any of the exposure categories identified in point (b). 6.   EBA shall, after consulting the ESRB, issue guidelines, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, by 30 June 2020 on the appropriate subsets of exposures to which the competent authority or the designated authority may apply a systemic risk buffer in accordance with point (f) of paragraph 5 of this Article. 7.   A systemic risk buffer shall apply to all exposures, or a subset of exposures as referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article, of all institutions, or one or more subsets of those institutions, for which the authorities of the Member State concerned are competent in accordance with this Directive and shall be set in steps of adjustment of 0,5 percentage points or multiples thereof. Different requirements may be introduced for different subsets of institutions and of exposures. The systemic risk buffer shall not address risks that are covered by Articles 130 and 131. 8.   When requiring a systemic risk buffer to be maintained the competent authority or the designated authority shall comply with the following:\n(a) the systemic risk buffer does not entail disproportionate adverse effects on the whole or parts of the financial system of other Member States or of the Union as a whole forming or creating an obstacle to the proper functioning of the internal market;\n(b) the systemic risk buffer is to be reviewed by the competent authority or the designated authority at least every second year;\n(c) the systemic risk buffer is not to be used to address risks that are covered by Articles 130 and 131. 9.   The competent authority or the designated authority, as applicable, shall notify the ESRB before the publication of the decision referred to in paragraph 13. The ESRB shall forward such notifications to the Commission, to EBA and to the competent and designated authorities of the Member States concerned without delay.\nWhere the institution to which one or more systemic risk buffer rates apply is a subsidiary the parent of which is established in another Member State, the competent authority or the designated authority shall also notify the authorities of that Member State.\nWhere a systemic risk buffer rate applies to exposures located in third countries, the competent authority or the designated authority, as applicable, shall also notify the ESRB. The ESRB shall forward such notifications without delay to the supervisory authorities of those third countries.\nSuch notifications shall set out in detail:\n(a) the macroprudential or systemic risks in the Member State;\n(b) the reasons why the dimension of the macroprudential or systemic risks threatens the stability of the financial system at national level justifying the systemic risk buffer rate;\n(c) the justification for why the systemic risk buffer is considered likely to be effective and proportionate to mitigate the risk;\n(d) an assessment of the likely positive or negative impact of the systemic risk buffer on the internal market, based on information which is available to the Member State;\n(e) the systemic risk buffer rate or rates that the competent authority or the designated authority, as applicable, intends to impose and the exposures to which such rates shall apply and the institutions which shall be subject to such rates;\n(f) where the systemic risk buffer rate applies to all exposures, a justification of why the authority considers that the systemic risk buffer is not duplicating the functioning of the O-SII buffer provided for in Article 131. Where the decision to set the systemic risk buffer rate results in a decrease or no change from the previously set buffer rate, the competent authority or the designated authority, as applicable, shall only comply with this paragraph. 10.   Where the setting or resetting of a systemic risk buffer rate or rates on any set or subset of exposures referred to in paragraph 5 subject to one or more systemic risk buffers does not result in a combined systemic risk buffer rate higher than 3 % for any of those exposures, the competent authority or the designated authority, as applicable, shall notify the ESRB in accordance with paragraph 9 one month before the publication of the decision referred to in paragraph 13. For the purposes of this paragraph, the recognition of a systemic risk buffer rate set by another Member State in accordance with Article 134 shall not count towards the 3 % threshold. 11.   Where the setting or resetting of a systemic risk buffer rate or rates on any set or subset of exposures referred to in paragraph 5 subject to one or more systemic risk buffers results in a combined systemic risk buffer rate at a level higher than 3 % and up to 5 % for any of those exposures, the competent authority or the designated authority of the Member State that sets that buffer shall request in the notification submitted in accordance with paragraph 9 the Commission's opinion. The Commission shall provide its opinion within one month of receipt of the notification.\nWhere the opinion of the Commission is negative, the competent authority or the designated authority, as applicable, of the Member State that sets that systemic risk buffer shall comply with that opinion or give reasons for not doing so.\nWhere an institution to which one or more systemic risk buffer rates apply is a subsidiary the parent of which is established in another Member State, the competent authority or the designated authority shall request in the notification submitted in accordance with paragraph 9 a recommendation by the Commission and the ESRB.\nThe Commission and the ESRB shall each provide its recommendation within six weeks of receipt of the notification.\nWhere the authorities of the subsidiary and of the parent disagree on the systemic risk buffer rate or rates applicable to that institution and in the case of a negative recommendation of both the Commission and the ESRB, the competent authority or the designated authority, as applicable, may refer the matter to EBA and request its assistance in accordance with Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. The decision to set the systemic risk buffer rate or rates for those exposures shall be suspended until EBA has taken a decision. 12.   Where the setting or resetting of a systemic risk buffer rate or rates on any set or subset of exposures referred to in paragraph 5 subject to one or more systemic risk buffers results in a combined systemic risk buffer rate higher than 5 % for any of those exposures, the competent authority or the designated authority, as applicable, shall seek the authorisation of the Commission before implementing a systemic risk buffer.\nWithin six weeks of receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 9 of this Article, the ESRB shall provide the Commission with an opinion as to whether the systemic risk buffer is deemed appropriate. EBA may also provide the Commission with its opinion on that systemic risk buffer in accordance with Article 34(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. Within three months of receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 9, the Commission, taking into account the assessment of the ESRB and EBA, where relevant, and where it is satisfied that the systemic risk buffer rate or rates do not entail disproportionate adverse effects on the whole or parts of the financial system of other Member States or of the Union as a whole forming or creating an obstacle to the proper functioning of the internal market, shall adopt an act authorising the competent authority or the designated authority, as applicable, to adopt the proposed measure. 13.   Each competent authority, or the designated authority, as applicable, shall announce the setting or resetting of one or more systemic risk buffer rates by publication on an appropriate website. That publication shall include at least the following information:\n(a) the systemic risk buffer rate or rates;\n(b) the institutions to which the systemic risk buffer applies;\n(c) the exposures to which the systemic risk buffer rate or rates apply;\n(d) a justification for setting or resetting the systemic risk buffer rate or rates;\n(e) the date from which the institutions shall apply the setting or resetting of the systemic risk buffer; and\n(f) the names of the countries where exposures located in those countries are recognised in the systemic risk buffer.\nWhere the publication of the information referred to in point (d) of the first subparagraph could jeopardise the stability of the financial system, that information shall not be included in the publication. 14.   Where an institution fails to fully meet the requirement set out in paragraph 1 of this Article, it shall be subject to the restrictions on distributions set out in Article 141(2) and (3).\nWhere the application of the restrictions on distributions leads to an unsatisfactory improvement of the Common Equity Tier 1 capital of the institution in light of the relevant systemic risk, the competent authorities may take additional measures in accordance with Article 64. 15.   Where the competent authority or the designated authority, as applicable, decides to set the systemic risk buffer on the basis of exposures located in other Member States, the buffer shall be set equally on all exposures located within the Union, unless the buffer is set to recognise the systemic risk buffer rate set by another Member State in accordance with Article 134. Article 134\nRecognition of a systemic risk buffer rate 1.   Other Member States may recognise a systemic risk buffer rate set in accordance with Article 133 and may apply that rate to domestically authorised institutions for exposures located in the Member State that sets that rate. 2.   Where Member States recognise a systemic risk buffer rate for domestically authorised institutions in accordance with paragraph 1, they shall notify the ESRB. The ESRB shall forward such notifications to the Commission, to EBA and to the Member State that sets that rate without delay. 3.   When deciding whether to recognise a systemic risk buffer rate in accordance with paragraph 1, a Member State shall take into consideration the information presented by the Member State that sets that rate in accordance with Article 133(9) and (13). 4.   Where Member States recognise a systemic risk buffer rate for domestically authorised institutions, that systemic risk buffer may be cumulative with the systemic risk buffer applied in accordance with Article 133, provided that the buffers address different risks. Where the buffers address the same risks, only the higher buffer shall apply. 5.   A Member State that sets a systemic risk buffer rate in accordance with Article 133 of this Directive may ask the ESRB to issue a recommendation as referred to in Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1092/2010 to one or more Member States which may recognise the systemic risk buffer rate.\u2019;\n(50) Article 136 is amended as follows:\n(a) in paragraph 3, the introductory part is replaced by the following:\n\u20183.   Each designated authority shall assess the intensity of cyclical systemic risk and the appropriateness of the countercyclical buffer rate for its Member State on a quarterly basis and set or adjust the countercyclical buffer rate, if necessary. In so doing, each designated authority shall take into account:\u2019;\n(b) paragraph 7 is replaced by the following:\n\u20187.   Each designated authority shall publish quarterly at least the following information on its website:\n(a) the applicable countercyclical buffer rate;\n(b) the relevant credit-to-GDP-ratio and its deviation from the long-term trend;\n(c) the buffer guide calculated in accordance with paragraph 2;\n(d) a justification for that buffer rate;\n(e) where the buffer rate is increased, the date from which institutions shall apply that increased buffer rate for the purpose of calculating their institution-specific countercyclical capital buffer;\n(f) where the date referred to in point (e) is less than 12 months after the date of the publication under this paragraph, a reference to the exceptional circumstances that justify that shorter deadline for application;\n(g) where the buffer rate is decreased, the indicative period during which no increase in the buffer rate is expected, together with a justification for that period.\nDesignated authorities shall take all reasonable steps to coordinate the timing of that publication.\nDesignated authorities shall notify each change of the countercyclical buffer rate and the required information specified in points (a) to (g) of the first subparagraph to the ESRB.
