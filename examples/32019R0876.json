        "text": "THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (2),\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),\nWhereas:\n(1) In the aftermath of the financial crisis that unfolded in 2007-2008, the Union implemented a substantial reform of the financial services regulatory framework to enhance the resilience of its financial institutions. That reform was largely based on international standards agreed in 2010 by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), known as the Basel III framework. Among its many measures, the reform package included the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) and Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (5), which strengthened the prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms (institutions).\n(2) While the reform has rendered the financial system more stable and resilient against many types of possible future shocks and crises, it did not address all identified problems. An important reason for that was that international standard setters, such as the BCBS and the Financial Stability Board (FSB), had not finished their work on internationally agreed solutions to tackle those problems at the time. Now that work on important additional reforms has been completed, the outstanding problems should be addressed.\n(3) In its communication of 24 November 2015 entitled \u2018Towards the completion of the Banking Union\u2019, the Commission recognised the need for further risk reduction and committed bringing forward a legislative proposal that would build on internationally agreed standards. The need to take further concrete legislative steps in terms of reducing risks in the financial sector has also been recognised by the Council in its conclusions of 17 June 2016 and by the European Parliament in its resolution of 10 March 2016 on the Banking Union \u2013 Annual Report 2015 (6).\n(4) Risk reduction measures should not only further strengthen the resilience of the European banking system and the markets' confidence in it, but also provide the basis for further progress in completing the banking union. Those measures should also be considered against the background of broader challenges affecting the Union economy, in particular the need to promote growth and jobs at times of uncertain economic outlook. In that context, various major policy initiatives, such as the Investment Plan for Europe and the capital markets union, have been launched in order to strengthen the economy of the Union. It is therefore important that all risk reduction measures interact smoothly with those policy initiatives as well as with broader recent reforms in the financial sector.\n(5) The provisions of this Regulation should be equivalent to internationally agreed standards and ensure the continued equivalence of Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 with the Basel III framework. The targeted adjustments in order to reflect Union specificities and broader policy considerations should be limited in terms of scope or time in order not to impinge on the overall soundness of the prudential framework.\n(6) Existing risk reduction measures and, in particular, reporting and disclosure requirements should also be improved to ensure that they can be applied in a more proportionate way and that they do not create an excessive compliance burden, especially for smaller and less complex institutions.\n(7) A precise definition of small and non-complex institutions is necessary for targeted simplifications of requirements with respect to the application of the principle of proportionality. By itself, a single absolute threshold does not take into account the specificities of the national banking markets. It is therefore necessary for Member States to be able to use their discretion to bring the threshold in line with domestic circumstances and adjust it downwards, as appropriate. Since the size of an institution is not in itself the defining factor for its risk profile, it is also necessary to apply additional qualitative criteria to ensure that an institution is only considered to be a small and non-complex institution and able to benefit from more proportionate rules where the institution fulfils all the relevant criteria.\n(8) Leverage ratios contribute to preserving financial stability by acting as a backstop to risk based capital requirements and by constraining the building up of excessive leverage during economic upturns. The BCBS has revised the international standard on the leverage ratio in order to specify further certain aspects of the design of that ratio. Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 should be aligned with the revised standard so as to ensure a level playing field internationally for institutions established inside the Union but operating outside the Union, and to ensure that leverage ratio remains an effective complement to risk-based own funds requirements. Therefore, a leverage ratio requirement should be introduced to complement the current system of reporting and disclosure of the leverage ratio.\n(9) In order not to unnecessarily constrain lending by institutions to corporates and private households and to prevent unwarranted adverse impacts on market liquidity, the leverage ratio requirement should be set at a level where it acts as a credible backstop to the risk of excessive leverage without hampering economic growth.\n(10) The European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority) (EBA), established by Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7), concluded in its report of 3 August 2016 on the leverage ratio requirement that a Tier 1 capital leverage ratio calibrated at 3 % for any type of credit institution would constitute a credible backstop function. A 3 % leverage ratio requirement was also agreed upon at international level by the BCBS. The leverage ratio requirement should therefore be calibrated at 3 %.\n(11) A 3 % leverage ratio requirement would however constrain certain business models and lines of business more than others. In particular, public lending by public development banks and officially supported export credits would be impacted disproportionally. The leverage ratio should therefore be adjusted for those types of exposures. Clear criteria that help ascertain the public mandate of such credit institutions should therefore be set out and cover aspects such as their establishment, the type of activities undertaken, their goal, the guarantee arrangements by public bodies and limits to deposit taking activities. The form and manner of establishment of such credit institutions should remain, however, at the discretion of Member State's central government, regional government or local authority and may consist of setting up a new credit institution, acquisition or take-over, including through concessions and in the context of resolution proceedings, of an already existing entity by such public authorities.\n(12) A leverage ratio should also not undermine the provision of central clearing services by institutions to clients. Therefore, the initial margin on centrally cleared derivative transactions received by institutions from their clients and that they pass on to central counterparties (CCPs), should be excluded from the total exposure measure.\n(13) In exceptional circumstances that warrant the exclusion of certain exposures to central banks from the leverage ratio and in order to facilitate the implementation of monetary policies, competent authorities should be able to exclude such exposures from the total exposure measure on a temporary basis. For that purpose, they should publicly declare, after consultation with the relevant central bank, that such exceptional circumstances exist. The leverage ratio requirement should be recalibrated commensurately to offset the impact of the exclusion. Such recalibration should ensure the exclusion of risks to financial stability affecting the relevant banking sectors, and that the resilience provided by the leverage ratio is maintained.\n(14) It is appropriate to implement a leverage ratio buffer requirement for institutions identified as global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs) in accordance with Directive 2013/36/EU and with the BCBSs standard on a leverage ratio buffer for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) published in December 2017. The leverage ratio buffer was calibrated by the BCBS for the specific purpose of mitigating the comparably larger risks to financial stability posed by G-SIBs and, against that background, should only apply to G-SIIs at this stage. However, further analysis should be done to determine whether it would be appropriate to apply the leverage ratio buffer requirement to other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs), as defined in Directive 2013/36/EU, and, if that is the case, in what manner the calibration should be tailored to the specific features of those institutions.\n(15) On 9 November 2015, the FSB published the Total Loss-absorbing Capacity (TLAC) Term Sheet (the \u2018TLAC standard\u2019) which was endorsed by the G20 at the November 2015 summit in Turkey. The TLAC standard requires G-SIBs, to hold a sufficient amount of highly loss absorbing (bail-inable) liabilities to ensure smooth and fast absorption of losses and recapitalisation in the event of a resolution. The TLAC standard should be implemented in Union law.\n(16) The implementation of the TLAC standard in Union law needs to take into account the existing institution-specific minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL), set out in Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (8). As the TLAC standard and the MREL pursue the same objective of ensuring that institutions have sufficient loss absorption capacity, the two requirements should be complementary elements of a common framework. Operationally, the harmonised minimum level of the TLAC standard should be introduced into Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 through a new requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities, while the institution-specific add-on for G-SIIs and the institution-specific requirement for non-G-SIIs should be introduced through targeted amendments to Directive 2014/59/EU and Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9). The provisions introducing the TLAC standard in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 should be read together with the provisions that are introduced into Directive 2014/59/EU and Regulation (EU) No 806/2014, and with Directive 2013/36/EU.\n(17) In accordance with the TLAC standard that only covers G-SIBs, the minimum requirement for a sufficient amount of own funds and highly loss absorbing liabilities introduced in this Regulation should only apply to G-SIIs. However, the rules concerning eligible liabilities introduced in this Regulation should apply to all institutions, in line with the complementary adjustments and requirements set out in Directive 2014/59/EU.\n(18) In line with the TLAC standard, the requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities should apply to resolution entities which are either themselves G-SIIs or are part of a group identified as a G-SII. The requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities should apply on either an individual basis or a consolidated basis, depending on whether such resolution entities are stand-alone institutions with no subsidiaries or parent undertakings.\n(19) Directive 2014/59/EU allows for resolution tools to be used not only for institutions but also for financial holding companies and mixed financial holding companies. Parent financial holding companies and parent mixed financial holding companies should therefore have sufficient loss absorption capacity in the same way as parent institutions.\n(20) To ensure the effectiveness of the requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities, it is essential that the instruments held for meeting that requirement have a high loss absorption capacity. Liabilities that are excluded from the bail-in tool referred to in Directive 2014/59/EU do not have that capacity, and neither do other liabilities that, although bail-inable in principle might raise difficulties for being bailed in in practice. Those liabilities should therefore not be considered eligible for the requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities. On the other hand, capital instruments, as well as subordinated liabilities have a high loss absorption capacity. Also, the loss absorption potential of liabilities that rank pari passu with certain excluded liabilities should be recognised up to a certain extent, in line with the TLAC standard.\n(21) To avoid double counting of liabilities for the purposes of the requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities, rules should be introduced for the deduction of holdings of eligible liabilities items that mirror the corresponding deduction approach already developed in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 for capital instruments. Under that approach, holdings of eligible liabilities instruments should first be deducted from eligible liabilities and, to the extent there are not sufficient liabilities, those eligible liabilities instruments should be deducted from Tier 2 instruments.\n(22) The TLAC standard contains some eligibility criteria for liabilities that are stricter than the current eligibility criteria for capital instruments. To ensure consistency, eligibility criteria for capital instruments should be aligned as regards the non-eligibility of instruments issued through special purpose entities as of 1 January 2022.\n(23) It is necessary to provide for a clear and transparent approval process for Common Equity Tier 1 instruments that can contribute to maintaining the high quality of those instruments. To that end, competent authorities should be responsible for approving those instruments before institutions can classify them as Common Equity Tier 1 instruments. However, competent authorities should not need to require prior permission for Common Equity Tier 1 instruments that are issued on the basis of legal documentation already approved by the competent authority and governed by substantially the same provisions as those governing capital instruments for which the institution has received prior permission from the competent authority to classify as Common Equity Tier 1 instruments. In such a case, instead of requesting prior approval, it should be possible for institutions to notify their competent authorities of their intention to issue such instruments. They should do so sufficiently in advance of the instruments' classification as Common Equity Tier 1 instruments to leave time to competent authorities to review the instruments, if necessary. In view of EBA's role in furthering the convergence of supervisory practices and enhancing the quality of own funds instruments, competent authorities should consult EBA before approving any new form of Common Equity Tier 1 instruments.\n(24) Capital instruments are eligible as Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 instruments only to the extent that they comply with the relevant eligibility criteria. Such capital instruments may consist of equity or liabilities, including subordinated loans that fulfil those criteria.\n(25) Capital instruments or parts of capital instruments should only be eligible to qualify as own funds instruments to the extent they are paid up. As long as parts of an instrument are not paid up, those parts should not be eligible to qualify as own funds instruments.\n(26) Own funds instruments and eligible liabilities should not be subject to set-off or netting arrangements which would undermine their loss absorption capacity in resolution. This should not mean that the contractual provisions governing the liabilities should contain a clause explicitly stating that the instrument is not subject to set-off or netting rights.\n(27) Due to the evolution of the banking sector in an even more digital environment, software is becoming a more important type of asset. Prudently valued software assets, the value of which is not materially affected by the resolution, insolvency or liquidation of an institution, should not be subject to the deduction of intangible assets from Common Equity Tier 1 items. That specification is important, as software is a broad concept that covers many different types of assets, not all of which preserve their value in the situation of a gone concern. In that context, differences in the valuation and amortisation of software assets and the realised sales of such assets should be taken into account. Furthermore, consideration should be given to international developments and differences in the regulatory treatment of investments in software, to different prudential rules that apply to institutions and insurance undertakings, and to the diversity of the financial sector in the Union, including non-regulated entities such as financial technology companies.\n(28) In order to avoid cliff-edge effects, it is necessary to grandfather the existing instruments with respect to certain eligibility criteria. For liabilities issued before 27 June 2019, certain eligibility criteria for own funds instruments and eligible liabilities should be waived. Such a grandfathering should apply to liabilities counting towards, where applicable, the subordinated portion of TLAC, and the subordinated portion of the MREL under Directive 2014/59/EU, as well as to liabilities counting towards, where applicable, the non-subordinated portion of TLAC, and the non-subordinated portion of the MREL under Directive 2014/59/EU. For own funds instruments, the grandfathering should end on 28 June 2025.\n(29) Eligible liabilities instruments, including those which have a residual maturity of less than one year, can only be redeemed after the resolution authority has granted its prior permission. Such prior permission could also be a general prior permission, in which case the redemption would have to occur within the limited period of time and for a predetermined amount covered by the general prior permission.\n(30) Since the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the international standard on the prudential treatment of institutions' exposures to CCPs has been amended in order to improve the treatment of institutions' exposures to qualifying CCPs (QCCPs). Notable revisions of that standard included the use of a single method for determining the own funds requirement for exposures due to default fund contributions, an explicit cap on the overall own funds requirements applied to exposures to QCCPs, and a more risk-sensitive approach for capturing the value of derivatives in the calculation of the hypothetical resources of a QCCP. At the same time, the treatment of exposures to non-qualifying CCPs was left unchanged. Given that the revised international standards introduced a treatment that is better suited to the central clearing environment, Union law should be amended to incorporate those standards.\n(31) In order to ensure that institutions adequately manage their exposures in the form of units or shares in collective investment undertakings (CIUs), the rules spelling out the treatment of those exposures should be risk sensitive and should promote transparency with respect to the underlying exposures of CIUs. The BCBS has therefore adopted a revised standard that sets a clear hierarchy of approaches to calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts for those exposures. That hierarchy reflects the degree of transparency over the underlying exposures. Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 should be aligned with those internationally agreed rules.\n(32) For an institution that provides a minimum value commitment to the ultimate benefit of retail clients for an investment in a unit or share in a CIU including as part of a government-sponsored private pension scheme, no payment by the institution or undertaking included in the same scope of prudential consolidation is required unless the value of the customer's shares or units in the CIU falls below the guaranteed amount at one or more points in time specified in the contract. The likelihood of the commitment being exercised is therefore low in practice. Where an institution's minimum value commitment is limited to a percentage of the amount that a client had originally invested into shares or units in a CIU (fixed-amount minimum value commitment) or to an amount that depends on the performance of financial indicators or market indices up to a given time, any currently positive difference between the value of the customer's shares or units and the present value of the guaranteed amount at a given date constitutes a buffer and reduces the risk for the institution to have to pay out the guaranteed amount. All those reasons justify a reduced conversion factor.\n(33) For calculating the exposure value of derivative transactions under the counterparty credit risk framework, Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 currently gives institutions the choice between three different standardised approaches: the Standardised Method (SM), the Mark-to-Market Method (MtMM) and the Original Exposure Method (OEM).\n(34) Those standardised approaches however do not recognise appropriately the risk-reducing nature of collateral in the exposures. Their calibrations are outdated and they do not reflect the high level of volatility observed during the financial crisis. Neither do they recognise appropriately netting benefits. To address those shortcomings, the BCBS decided to replace the SM and the MtMM with a new standardised approach for computing the exposure value of derivative exposures, the so-called Standardised Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR). Given that the revised international standards introduced a new standardised approach that is better suited to the central clearing environment, Union law should be amended to incorporate those standards.\n(35) The SA-CCR is more risk sensitive than the SM and the MtMM and should therefore lead to own funds requirements that better reflect the risks related to institutions' derivative transactions. At the same time, for some of the institutions which currently use the MtMM the SA-CCR may prove to be too complex and burdensome to implement. For institutions that meet predefined eligibility criteria, and for institutions that are part of a group which meets those criteria on a consolidated basis, a simplified version of the SA-CCR (the \u2018simplified SA-CCR\u2019) should be introduced. Since such a simplified version will be less risk sensitive than the SA-CCR, it should be appropriately calibrated in order to ensure that it does not underestimate the exposure value of derivative transactions.\n(36) For institutions which have limited derivative exposures and which currently use the MtMM or the OEM, both the SA-CCR and the simplified SA-CCR could be too complex to implement. The OEM should therefore be reserved as an alternative approach for those institutions that meet predefined eligibility criteria, and for institutions that are part of a group which meets those criteria on a consolidated basis, but should be revised in order to address its major shortcomings.\n(37) To guide an institution in its choice of permitted approaches clear criteria should be introduced. Those criteria should be based on the size of the derivative activities of an institution which indicates the degree of sophistication an institution should be able to comply with to compute the exposure value.\n(38) During the financial crisis, trading book losses for some institutions established in the Union were substantial. For some of them, the level of capital required against those losses proved insufficient, leading them to seek extraordinary public financial support. Those observations led the BCBS to remove a number of weaknesses in the prudential treatment for trading book positions which are the own funds requirements for market risk.\n(39) In 2009, the first set of reforms was finalised at international level and transposed into Union law by means of Directive 2010/76/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (10). The 2009 reform, however, did not address the structural weaknesses of the own funds requirements for market risk standards. The lack of clarity about the boundary between the trading and banking books gave opportunities for regulatory arbitrage while the lack of risk sensitivity of the own funds requirements for market risk did not allow to capture the full range of risks to which institutions were exposed.\n(40) The BCBS initiated the fundamental review of the trading book (FRTB) to address the structural weaknesses of the own funds requirements for market risk standards. That work led to the publication in January 2016 of a revised market risk framework. In December 2017, the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision agreed to extend the implementation date of the revised market risk framework in order to allow institutions additional time to develop the necessary systems infrastructure but also for the BCBS to address certain specific issues related to the framework. This includes a review of the calibrations of the standardised and internal model approaches to ensure consistency with the BCBSs original expectations. Upon finalisation of that review, and before an impact assessment is performed to assess the impact of the resulting revisions to the FRTB framework on institutions in the Union, all institutions that would be subject to the FRTB framework in the Union should start reporting the calculations derived from the revised standardised approach. To that end, in order to make the calculations for reporting requirements fully operational in line with international developments, the power to adopt an act in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) should be delegated to the Commission. The Commission should adopt that delegated act by 31 December 2019. Institutions should start reporting that calculation no later than one year after the adoption of that delegated act. In addition, institutions that obtain approval to use the revised internal model approach of the FRTB framework for reporting purposes should also report the calculation under the internal model approach three years after its full operationalisation.\n(41) Introducing reporting requirements for the FRTB approaches should be considered as a first step towards the full implementation of the FRTB framework in the Union. Taking into account the final revisions to the FRTB framework performed by the BCBS, the results of the impact of those revisions on institutions in the Union and on the FRTB approaches already set out in this Regulation for reporting requirements, the Commission should submit, where appropriate, a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council by 30 June 2020 on how the FRTB framework should be implemented in the Union to establish the own funds requirements for market risk.\n(42) A proportionate treatment for market risk should also apply to institutions with limited trading book activities, allowing more institutions with small trading book activities to apply the credit risk framework for banking book positions as set out under a revised version of the derogation for small trading book business. The principle of proportionality should also be taken into account when the Commission reassesses how institutions with medium-sized trading book business should calculate the own funds requirements for market risk. In particular, the calibration of the own funds requirements for market risk for institutions with medium-sized trading book business should be reviewed in light of developments at international level. In the meantime, institutions with medium-sized trading book business, as well institutions with small trading book business, should be exempted from the reporting requirements under the FRTB.\n(43) The large exposures framework should be strengthened to improve the ability of institutions to absorb losses and to better comply with international standards. To that end, a higher quality of capital should be used as a capital base for the calculation of the large exposures limit and exposures to credit derivatives should be calculated in accordance with the SA-CCR. Moreover, the limit on the exposures that G-SIIs may have towards other G-SIIs should be lowered to reduce systemic risks related to interlinks among large institutions and the impact that the default of G-SIIs counterparty may have on financial stability.\n(44) While the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) ensures that institutions will be able to withstand severe stress on a short-term basis, it does not ensure that those institutions will have a stable funding structure on a longer-term horizon. It became thus apparent that a detailed binding stable funding requirement should be developed at Union level which should be met at all times with the aim of preventing excessive maturity mismatches between assets and liabilities and overreliance on short-term wholesale funding.\n(45) Consistent with the BCBSs stable funding standard, rules should, therefore, be adopted to define the stable funding requirement as a ratio of an institution's amount of available stable funding to its amount of required stable funding over a one-year horizon. That binding requirement should be called the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) requirement. The amount of available stable funding should be calculated by multiplying the institution's liabilities and own funds by appropriate factors that reflect their degree of reliability over the one-year horizon of the NSFR. The amount of required stable funding should be calculated by multiplying the institution's assets and off-balance-sheet exposures by appropriate factors that reflect their liquidity characteristics and residual maturities over the one-year horizon of the NSFR.\n(46) The NSFR should be expressed as a percentage and set at a minimum level of 100 %, which indicates that an institution holds sufficient stable funding to meet its funding needs over a one-year horizon under both normal and stressed conditions. Should its NSFR fall below the 100 % level, the institution should comply with the specific requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 for a timely restoration of its NSFR to the minimum level. The application of supervisory measures in cases of non-compliance with the NSFR requirement should not be automatic. Competent authorities should instead assess the reasons for non-compliance with the NSFR requirement before defining potential supervisory measures.\n(47) In accordance with the recommendations made by EBA in its report of 15 December 2015 on net stable funding requirements under Article 510 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 the rules for calculating the NSFR should be closely aligned with the BCBSs standards, including developments in those standards regarding the treatment of derivative transactions. The necessity to take into account some European specificities to ensure that the NSFR requirement does not hinder the financing of the European real economy, however, justifies adopting some adjustments to the NSFR developed by the BCBS for the definition of the European NSFR requirement. Those adjustments due to the European context are recommended by EBA and relate mainly to specific treatments for: pass-through models in general and covered bonds issuance in particular; trade finance activities; centralised regulated savings; residential guaranteed loans; credit unions; CCPs and central securities depositories (CSDs) not undertaking any significant maturity transformation. Those proposed specific treatments broadly reflect the preferential treatment granted to those activities in the European LCR compared to the LCR developed by the BCBS. Because the NSFR complements the LCR, those two ratios should be consistent in their definition and calibration. This is in particular the case for required stable funding factors applied to LCR high quality liquid assets for the calculation of the NSFR that should reflect the definitions and haircuts of the European LCR, regardless of compliance with the general and operational requirements set out for the LCR calculation that are not appropriate in the one-year horizon of the NSFR calculation.\n(48) Beyond European specificities, the treatment of derivative transactions in the NSFR developed by the BCBS could have an important impact on institutions' derivative activities and, consequently, on European financial markets and on the access to some operations for end-users. Derivative transactions and some interlinked transactions, including clearing activities, could be unduly and disproportionately impacted by the introduction of the NSFR developed by BCBS without having been subject to extensive quantitative impact studies and public consultation. The additional requirement to hold between 5 % and 20 % of stable funding against gross derivative liabilities is very widely seen as a rough measure to capture additional funding risks related to the potential increase of derivative liabilities over a one-year horizon and is under review at BCBS level. That requirement, introduced at a level of 5 % in line with the discretion left to jurisdictions by the BCBS to reduce the required stable funding factor on gross derivative liabilities, could then be amended to take into account developments at the BCBS level and to avoid possible unintended consequences such as hindering the good functioning of the European financial markets and the provision of risk hedging tools to institutions and end-users, including corporates, to ensure their financing as an objective of the capital markets union.\n(49) The asymmetric treatment by the BCBS of short-term funding, such as repos (stable funding not recognised) and short-term lending, such as reverse repos (some stable funding required \u2013 10 % if collateralised by level 1 high quality liquid assets (HQLA) as defined in the LCR and 15 % for other transactions) with financial customers is intended to discourage extensive short-term funding links between financial customers, because such links are a source of interconnection and make it more difficult to resolve a particular institution without a contagion of risk to the rest of the financial system in case of failure. However, the calibration of the asymmetry is conservative and may affect the liquidity of securities usually used as collateral in short-term transactions, in particular sovereign bonds, as institutions will probably reduce the volume of their operations on repo markets. It could also undermine market-making activities, because repo markets facilitate the management of the necessary inventory, thereby contradicting the objectives of the capital markets union. To allow for sufficient time for institutions to progressively adapt to that conservative calibration, a transitional period, during which the required stable funding factors would be temporarily reduced, should be introduced. The size of the temporary reduction in the required stable funding factors should depend on the types of transactions and on the type of collateral used in those transactions.\n(50) In addition to the temporary recalibration of the BCBS required stable funding factor that applies to short-term reverse repo transactions with financial customers secured by sovereign bonds, some other adjustments have proven to be necessary to ensure that the introduction of the NSFR requirement does not hinder the liquidity of sovereign bonds markets. The BCBS 5 % required stable funding factor that applies to level 1 HQLA, including sovereign bonds, implies that institutions would need to hold ready available long-term unsecured funding in such percentage regardless of the time during which they expect to hold such sovereign bonds. This could potentially further incentivise institutions to deposit cash at central banks rather than to act as primary dealers and provide liquidity in sovereign bond markets. Moreover, it is not consistent with the LCR that recognises the full liquidity of those assets even in time of severe liquidity stress (0 % haircut). The required stable funding factor of level 1 HQLA as defined in the European LCR, excluding extremely high quality covered bonds, should therefore be reduced from 5 % to 0 %.\n(51) Furthermore, all level 1 HQLA as defined in the European LCR, excluding extremely high quality covered bonds, received as variation margin in derivative contracts should offset derivative assets while the NSFR developed by the BCBS only accepts cash respecting the conditions of the leverage framework to offset derivative assets. That broader recognition of assets received as variation margin will contribute to the liquidity of sovereign bonds markets, avoid penalising end-users that hold high amounts of sovereign bonds but few cash (like pension funds) and avoid adding additional tensions on the demand for cash on repo markets.\n(52) The NSFR requirement should apply to institutions both on an individual and a consolidated basis, unless competent authorities waive the application of the NSFR requirement on an individual basis. Where the application of the NSFR requirement on an individual basis has not been waived, transactions between two institutions belonging to the same group or to the same institutional protection scheme should in principle receive symmetrical available and required stable funding factors to avoid a loss of funding in the internal market and to not impede the effective liquidity management in European groups where liquidity is centrally managed. Such preferential symmetrical treatments should only be granted to intragroup transactions where all the necessary safeguards are in place, on the basis of additional criteria for cross-border transactions, and only with the prior approval of the competent authorities involved as it cannot be assumed that institutions experiencing difficulties in meeting their payment obligations will always receive funding support from other undertakings belonging to the same group or to the same institutional protection scheme.\n(53) Small and non-complex institutions should be given the opportunity to use a simplified version of the NSFR requirement. A simplified, less granular version of the NSFR should involve collecting a limited number of data points, which would, reduce the complexity of the calculation for those institutions in accordance with the principle of proportionality, while ensuring that those institutions still maintain a sufficient stable funding factor by means of a calibration that should be at least as conservative as the one of the fully-fledged NSFR requirement. However, competent authorities should be able to require small and non-complex institutions to apply the fully-fledged NSFR requirement instead of the simplified version.\n(54) The consolidation of subsidiaries in third countries should take due account of the stable funding requirements applicable in those countries. Accordingly, consolidation rules in the Union should not introduce a more favourable treatment for available and required stable funding in third-country subsidiaries than the treatment which is available under the national law of those third countries.\n(55) Institutions should be required to report to their competent authorities in the reporting currency the binding detailed NSFR for all items and separately for items denominated in each significant currency to ensure an appropriate monitoring of possible currencies mismatches. The NSFR requirement should not subject institutions to any double reporting requirements or to reporting requirements not in line with the rules in force and institutions should be granted sufficient time to get prepared to the entry into force of new reporting requirements.\n(56) As the provision of meaningful and comparable information to the market on institutions' common key risk metrics is a fundamental tenet of a sound banking system, it is essential to reduce information asymmetry as much as possible and facilitate comparability of credit institutions' risk profiles within and across jurisdictions. The BCBS published the revised Pillar 3 disclosure standards in January 2015 to enhance the comparability, quality and consistency of institutions' regulatory disclosures to the market. It is, therefore, appropriate to amend the existing disclosure requirements to implement those new international standards.\n(57) Respondents to the Commission's call for evidence on the EU regulatory framework for financial services regarded current disclosure requirements as disproportionate and burdensome for smaller institutions. Without prejudice to aligning disclosures more closely with international standards, small and non-complex institutions should be required to produce less frequent and detailed disclosures than their larger peers, thus reducing the administrative burden to which they are subject.\n(58) Some clarifications should be made to the remuneration disclosures. The disclosure requirements relating to remuneration as set out in this Regulation should be compatible with the aims of the remuneration rules, namely to establish and maintain, for categories of staff whose professional activities have a material impact on the institution's risk profile, remuneration policies and practices that are consistent with effective risk management. Furthermore, institutions benefitting from a derogation from certain remuneration rules should be required to disclose information concerning such derogation.\n(59) Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are one of the pillars of the Union's economy as they play a fundamental role in creating economic growth and providing employment. Given the fact that SMEs carry a lower systematic risk than larger corporates, capital requirements for SME exposures should be lower than those for large corporates to ensure an optimal bank financing of SMEs. Currently, SME exposures of up to EUR 1,5 million are subject to a 23,81 % reduction in risk weighted exposure amount. Given that the threshold of EUR 1,5 million for an SME exposure is not indicative of a change in riskiness of an SME, reduction in capital requirements should be extended to SME exposures of up to EUR 2,5 million and the part of an SME exposure exceeding EUR 2,5 million should be subject to a 15 % reduction in capital requirements.\n(60) Investments in infrastructure are essential to strengthen Europe's competitiveness and to stimulate job creation. The recovery and future growth of the Union economy depends largely on the availability of capital for strategic investments of European significance in infrastructure, in particular broadband and energy networks, as well as transport infrastructure including electromobility infrastructure, particularly in industrial centres; education, research and innovation; and renewable energy and energy efficiency. The Investment Plan for Europe aims at promoting additional funding to viable infrastructure projects through, inter alia, the mobilisation of additional private sources of finance. For a number of potential investors the main concern is the perceived absence of viable projects and the limited capacity to properly evaluate risk given their intrinsically complex nature.\n(61) In order to encourage private and public investments in infrastructure projects it is essential to lay down a regulatory environment that is able to promote high quality infrastructure projects and reduce risks for investors. In particular, own funds requirements for exposures to infrastructure projects should be reduced, provided they comply with a set of criteria able to reduce their risk profile and enhance predictability of cash flows. The Commission should review the provision on high quality infrastructure projects in order to assess: its impact on the volume of infrastructure investments by institutions and the quality of investments having regard to Union's objectives to move towards a low-carbon, climate-resilient and circular economy; and its adequacy from a prudential standpoint. The Commission should also consider whether the scope of those provisions should be extended to infrastructure investments by corporates.\n(62) As recommended by EBA, the European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority) (ESMA) established by Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11) and the European Central Bank, CCPs, due to their distinct business model, should be exempted from the leverage ratio requirement, because they are required to obtain a banking licence simply for the reason of being granted access to overnight central bank facilities and to fulfil their roles as key vehicles for the achievement of important political and regulatory objectives in the financial sector.\n(63) Furthermore, exposures of CSDs authorised as credit institutions and exposures of credit institutions designated in accordance with Article 54(2) of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12), such as cash balances resulting from the provision of cash accounts to, and accepting deposits from, participants in a securities settlement system and holders of securities accounts, should be excluded from the total exposure measure as they do not create a risk of excessive leverage as those cash balances are used solely for the purpose of settling transaction in securities settlement systems.\n(64) Given that the guidance on additional own funds referred to in Directive 2013/36/EU is a capital target that reflects supervisory expectations, it should not be subject either to mandatory disclosure or to the prohibition of disclosure by competent authorities under Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 or that Directive.\n(65) In order to ensure an appropriate definition of some specific technical provisions of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and to take into account possible developments in standards at international level, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission: in respect of amending the list of products or services the assets and liabilities of which can be considered as interdependent; in respect of amending the list of multilateral development banks; in respect of amending market risk reporting requirements; and in respect of specifying additional liquidity requirements. Before the adoption of those acts it is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Inter-institutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (13). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n(66) Technical standards should ensure the consistent harmonisation of the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. As a body with highly specialised expertise, EBA should be mandated to develop draft regulatory technical standards which do not involve policy choices, for submission to the Commission. Regulatory technical standards should be developed in the areas of prudential consolidation, own funds, TLAC, the treatment of exposures secured by mortgages on immovable property, equity investment into funds, the calculation of loss given defaults under the Internal Ratings Based Approach for credit risk, market risk, large exposures and liquidity. The Commission should be empowered to adopt those regulatory technical standards by means of delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 TFEU and in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. The Commission and EBA should ensure that those standards and requirements can be applied by all institutions concerned in a manner that is proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of those institutions and their activities.\n(67) To facilitate the comparability of disclosures, EBA should be mandated to develop draft implementing technical standards establishing standardised disclosure templates covering all substantial disclosure requirements set out in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. When developing those standards, EBA should take into account the size and complexity of institutions, as well as the nature and level of risk of their activities. EBA should report on where proportionality of the Union supervisory reporting package could be improved in terms of scope, granularity or frequency and, at least, submit concrete recommendations as to how the average compliance costs for small institutions can be reduced by ideally 20 % or more and at least 10 % by means of appropriate simplification of requirements. EBA should be mandated to develop draft implementing technical standards that are to accompany that report. The Commission should be empowered to adopt those implementing technical standards by means of implementing acts pursuant to Article 291 TFEU and in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.\n(68) In order to facilitate institutions' compliance with the rules set out in this Regulation and in Directive 2013/36/EU, as well as with regulatory technical standards, implementing technical standards, guidelines and templates adopted to implement those rules, EBA should develop an IT tool aimed at guiding institutions through the relevant provisions, standards, guidelines and templates in relation to their size and business model.\n(69) In addition to the report on possible cost reductions, by 28 June 2020 EBA should \u2013 in cooperation with all relevant authorities, namely those authorities that are responsible for prudential supervision, resolution and deposit guarantee schemes and in particular the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) \u2013 prepare a feasibility report regarding the development of a consistent and integrated system for collecting statistical data, resolution data and prudential data. Taking into account the previous work of the ESCB on integrated data collection, that report should provide a cost and benefit analysis regarding the creation of a central data collection point for an integrated data reporting system as regards statistical and regulatory data for all institutions located in the Union. Such a system should, amongst other things, use consistent definitions and standards for the data to be collected, and guarantee a reliable and permanent exchange of information between the competent authorities thereby ensuring strict confidentiality of the data collected, strong authentication and management of access right to the system as well as cybersecurity. By centralising and harmonising the European reporting landscape in such a way, the goal is to prevent multiple requests for similar or identical data from different authorities and thereby to significantly reduce the administrative and financial burden, both for the competent authorities and for the institutions. If appropriate, and taking into account the feasibility report by EBA, the Commission should submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a legislative proposal.\n(70) The relevant competent or designated authorities should aim at avoiding any form of duplicative or inconsistent use of the macroprudential powers laid down in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Directive 2013/36/EU. In particular, the relevant competent or designated authorities should duly consider whether the measures that they take under Article 124, 164 or 458 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 duplicate or are inconsistent with other existing or upcoming measures under Article 133 of Directive 2013/36/EU.\n(71) In view of the amendments to the treatment of exposures to QCCPs, specifically to the treatment of institutions' contributions to QCCPs' default funds, laid down in this Regulation, the relevant provisions in Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 (14) which were introduced therein by Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and which spell out the calculation of the hypothetical capital of CCPs that is then used by institutions to calculate their own funds requirements should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(72) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely to reinforce and refine already existing Union legal acts ensuring uniform prudential requirements that apply to institutions throughout the Union, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of their scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(73) In order to allow for orderly divesting from insurance holdings which are not subject to supplementary supervision, an amended version of the transitional provisions in relation to the exemption from deducting equity holdings in insurance companies should be applied, with retroactive effect from 1 January 2019.\n(74) Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 should therefore be amended accordingly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:",

Paragraphs 3 to 6 and paragraph 9 of this Article shall not apply where Part Six and point (d) of Article 430(1) apply on the basis of the consolidated situation of an institution, financial holding company or mixed financial holding company or on the sub-consolidated situation of a liquidity sub-group as set out in Articles 8 and 10. For the purposes of Article 11(3a), institutions that are required to comply with the requirements referred to in Article 92a or 92b on a consolidated basis shall carry out a full consolidation of all institutions and financial institutions that are their subsidiaries in the relevant resolution groups. 2.   Ancillary services undertakings shall be included in consolidation in the cases, and in accordance with the methods, laid down in this Article. 3.   Where undertakings are related within the meaning of Article 22(7) of Directive 2013/34/EU, competent authorities shall determine how consolidation is to be carried out. 4.   The consolidating supervisor shall require the proportional consolidation according to the share of capital held of participations in institutions and financial institutions managed by an undertaking included in the consolidation together with one or more undertakings not included in the consolidation, where the liability of those undertakings is limited to the share of the capital they hold. 5.   In the case of participations or capital ties other than those referred to in paragraphs 1 and 4, competent authorities shall determine whether and how consolidation is to be carried out. In particular, they may permit or require the use of the equity method. That method shall not, however, constitute inclusion of the undertakings concerned in supervision on a consolidated basis. 6.   Competent authorities shall determine whether and how consolidation is to be carried out in the following cases:\n(a) where, in the opinion of the competent authorities, an institution exercises a significant influence over one or more institutions or financial institutions, but without holding a participation or other capital ties in those institutions; and\n(b) where two or more institutions or financial institutions are placed under single management other than pursuant to a contract, clauses of their memoranda or articles of association.\nIn particular, competent authorities may permit or require the use of the method provided for in Article 22(7), (8) and (9) of Directive 2013/34/EU. That method shall not, however, constitute inclusion of the undertakings concerned in consolidated supervision. 7.   Where an institution has a subsidiary which is an undertaking other than an institution, a financial institution or an ancillary services undertaking or holds a participation in such an undertaking, it shall apply to that subsidiary or participation the equity method. That method shall not, however, constitute inclusion of the undertakings concerned in supervision on a consolidated basis.\nBy way of derogation from the first subparagraph, competent authorities may allow or require institutions to apply a different method to such subsidiaries or participations, including the method required by the applicable accounting framework, provided that:\n(a) the institution does not already apply the equity method on 28 December 2020;\n(b) it would be unduly burdensome to apply the equity method or the equity method does not adequately reflect the risks that the undertaking referred to in the first subparagraph poses to the institution; and\n(c) the method applied does not result in full or proportional consolidation of that undertaking. 8.   Competent authorities may require full or proportional consolidation of a subsidiary or an undertaking in which an institution holds a participation where that subsidiary or undertaking is not an institution, financial institution or ancillary services undertaking and where all the following conditions are met:\n(a) the undertaking is not an insurance undertaking, a third-country insurance undertaking, a reinsurance undertaking, a third-country reinsurance undertaking, an insurance holding company or an undertaking excluded from the scope of Directive 2009/138/EC in accordance with Article 4 of that Directive;\n(b) there is a substantial risk that the institution decides to provide financial support to that undertaking in stressed conditions, in the absence of, or in excess of any contractual obligations to provide such support. 9.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify conditions in accordance with which consolidation shall be carried out in the cases referred to in paragraphs 3 to 6 and paragraph 8. EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2020. Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.\u2019;\n(13) Article 22 is replaced by the following\n\u2018Article 22\nSub-consolidation in case of entities in third countries 1.

By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, subsidiary institutions may choose not to apply the requirements laid down in Articles 89, 90 and 91 and Parts Three, Four and Seven and the associated reporting requirements laid down in Part Seven A on the basis of their sub-consolidated situation where the total assets and off-balance-sheet items of their subsidiaries and participations in third countries are less than 10 % of the total amount of the assets and off-balance-sheet items of the subsidiary institution.\u2019;\n(14) the title of Part Two is replaced by the following:\n                                    \u2018\n                                    OWN FUNDS AND ELIGIBLE LIABILITIES\n                                    \u2019;\n(15) in Article 26, paragraph 3 is replaced by the following:\n\u20183.   Competent authorities shall evaluate whether issuances of capital instruments meet the criteria set out in Article 28 or, where applicable, Article 29. Institutions shall classify issuances of capital instruments as Common Equity Tier 1 instruments only after permission is granted by the competent authorities.\nBy way of derogation from the first subparagraph, institutions may classify as Common Equity Tier 1 instruments subsequent issuances of a form of Common Equity Tier 1 instruments for which they have already received that permission, provided that both of the following conditions are met:\n(a) the provisions governing those subsequent issuances are substantially the same as the provisions governing those issuances for which the institutions have already received permission;\n(b) institutions have notified those subsequent issuances to the competent authorities sufficiently in advance of their classification as Common Equity Tier 1 instruments.\nCompetent authorities shall consult EBA before granting permission for new forms of capital instruments to be classified as Common Equity Tier 1 instruments. Competent authorities shall have due regard to EBA's opinion and, where they decide to deviate from it, shall write to EBA within three months from the date of receipt of EBA's opinion setting out the rationale for deviating from the relevant opinion. This subparagraph does not apply to the capital instruments referred to in Article 31. On the basis of information collected from competent authorities, EBA shall establish, maintain and publish a list of all forms of capital instruments in each Member State that qualify as Common Equity Tier 1 instruments. In accordance with Article 35 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, EBA may collect any information in connection with Common Equity Tier 1 instruments that it considers necessary to establish compliance with the criteria set out in Article 28 or, where applicable, Article 29 of this Regulation and for the purpose of maintaining and updating the list referred to in this subparagraph.\nFollowing the review process set out in Article 80 and where there is sufficient evidence that the relevant capital instruments do not meet or have ceased to meet the criteria set out in Article 28 or, where applicable, Article 29, EBA may decide not to add those instruments to the list referred to in the fourth subparagraph or remove them from that list, as the case may be.

The institution shall also notify the competent authority without delay of any changes to the profit and loss transfer agreement and the termination thereof.

Where the competent authority has granted permission for the reclassification of a position in accordance with paragraph 2, the institution which received that permission shall:\n(a) publicly disclose, without delay,\n(i) information that its position has been reclassified, and\n(ii) where the effect of that reclassification is a reduction in the institution's own funds requirements, the size of that reduction; and\n(b) where the effect of that reclassification is a reduction in the institution's own funds requirements, not recognise that effect until the position matures, unless the institution's competent authority permits it to recognise that effect at an earlier date. 4.   The institution shall calculate the net change in the amount of its own funds requirements arising from the reclassification of the position as the difference between the own funds requirements immediately after the reclassification and the own funds requirements immediately before the reclassification, each calculated in accordance with Article 92. The calculation shall not take into account the effects of any factors other than the reclassification. 5.

Where marking to market is not possible, institutions shall conservatively mark to model their positions and portfolios, including when calculating own funds requirements for positions in the trading book and positions measured at fair value in the non-trading book.\u2019;\n(d) in paragraph 7, the second subparagraph is replaced by the following:\n\u2018For the purposes of point (d) of the first subparagraph, the model shall be developed or approved independently of the trading desks and shall be independently tested, including validation of the mathematics, assumptions and software implementation.\u2019;\n(e) in paragraph 11, point (a) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(a) the additional amount of time it would take to hedge out the position or the risks within the position beyond the liquidity horizons that have been assigned to the risk factors of the position in accordance with Article 325bd;\u2019;\n(55) Article 106 is amended as follows:\n(a) paragraphs 2 and 3 are replaced by the following:\n\u20182.   The requirements set out in paragraph 1 shall apply without prejudice to the requirements applicable to the hedged position in the non-trading book or in the trading book, where relevant. 3.   Where an institution hedges a non-trading book credit risk exposure or counterparty risk exposure using a credit derivative booked in its trading book, that credit derivative position shall be recognised as an internal hedge of the non-trading book credit risk exposure or counterparty risk exposure for the purpose of calculating the risk-weighted exposure amounts referred to in point (a) of Article 92(3) where the institution enters into another credit derivative transaction with an eligible third party protection provider that meets the requirements for unfunded credit protection in the non-trading book and perfectly offsets the market risk of the internal hedge.\nBoth an internal hedge recognised in accordance with the first subparagraph and the credit derivative entered into with the third party shall be included in the trading book for the purpose of calculating the own funds requirements for market risk.\u2019;\n(b) the following paragraphs are added:\n\u20184.   Where an institution hedges a non-trading book equity risk exposure using an equity derivative booked in its trading book, that equity derivative position shall be recognised as an internal hedge of the non-trading book equity risk exposure for the purpose of calculating the risk-weighted exposure amounts referred to in point (a) of Article 92(3) where the institution enters into another equity derivative transaction with an eligible third party protection provider that meets the requirements for unfunded credit protection in the non-trading book and perfectly offsets the market risk of the internal hedge.\nBoth an internal hedge recognised in accordance with the first subparagraph and the equity derivative entered into with the eligible third party protection provider shall be included in the trading book for the purpose of calculating the own funds requirements for market risk. 5.   Where an institution hedges non-trading book interest rate risk exposures using an interest rate risk position booked in its trading book, that interest rate risk position shall be considered to be an internal hedge for the purpose of assessing the interest rate risk arising from non-trading positions in accordance with Articles 84 and 98 of Directive 2013/36/EU where the following conditions are met:\n(a) the position has been assigned to a separate portfolio from the other trading book position, the business strategy of which is solely dedicated to manage and mitigate the market risk of internal hedges of interest rate risk exposure; for that purpose, the institution may assign to that portfolio other interest rate risk positions entered into with third parties, or its own trading book as long as the institution perfectly offsets the market risk of those interest rate risk positions entered into with its own trading book by entering into opposite interest rate risk positions with third parties;\n(b) for the purposes of the reporting requirements set out in Article 430b(3), the position has been assigned to a trading desk established in accordance with Article 104b the business strategy of which is solely dedicated to manage and mitigate the market risk of internal hedges of interest rate risk exposure; for that purpose, that trading desk may enter into other interest rate risk positions with third parties or other trading desks of the institution, as long as those other trading desks perfectly offset the market risk of those other interest rate risk positions by entering into opposite interest rate risk positions with third parties;\n(c) the institution has fully documented how the position mitigates the interest rate risk arising from non-trading book positions for the purposes of the requirements laid down in Articles 84 and 98 of Directive 2013/36/EU. 6.   The own funds requirements for the market risk of all the positions assigned to a separate portfolio as referred to in point (a) of paragraph 5 shall be calculated on a stand-alone basis and shall be in addition to the own funds requirements for the other trading book positions. 7.   For the purposes of the reporting requirements set out in Article 430b, the calculation of the own funds requirements for market risk of all the positions assigned to the separate portfolio as referred to in point (a) of paragraph 5 of this Article or to the trading desk or entered into by the trading desk referred to in point (b) of paragraph 5 of this Article, where appropriate, shall be calculated on a stand-alone basis as a separate portfolio and shall be additional to the calculation of own funds requirements for the other trading book positions.\u2019;\n(56) in Article 107, paragraph 3 is replaced by the following:\n\u20183.   For the purposes of this Regulation, exposures to a third-country investment firm, a third-country credit institution and a third-country exchange shall be treated as exposures to an institution only where the third country applies prudential and supervisory requirements to that entity that are at least equivalent to those applied in the Union.\u2019;\n(57) in Article 117, paragraph 2 is amended as follows:\n(a) the following points are added:\n\u2018(o) the International Development Association;\n(p) the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.\u2019;\n(b) the following subparagraph is added:\n\u2018The Commission is empowered to amend this Regulation by adopting delegated acts in accordance with Article 462 amending, in accordance with international standards, the list of multilateral development banks referred to in the first subparagraph.\u2019;\n(58) in Article 118, point (a) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(a) the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community;\u2019;\n(59) in Article 123, the following paragraph is added:\n                                 \u2018Exposures due to loans granted by a credit institution to pensioners or employees with a permanent contract against the unconditional transfer of part of the borrower's pension or salary to that credit institution shall be assigned a risk weight of 35 %, provided that all the following conditions are met:\n(a) in order to repay the loan, the borrower unconditionally authorises the pension fund or employer to make direct payments to the credit institution by deducting the monthly payments on the loan from the borrower's monthly pension or salary;\n(b) the risks of death, inability to work, unemployment or reduction of the net monthly pension or salary of the borrower are properly covered through an insurance policy underwritten by the borrower to the benefit of the credit institution;\n(c) the monthly payments to be made by the borrower on all loans that meet the conditions set out in points (a) and (b) do not in aggregate exceed 20 % of the borrower's net monthly pension or salary;\n(d) the maximum original maturity of the loan is equal to or less than ten years.\u2019;\n(60) Article 124 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Article 124\nExposures secured by mortgages on immovable property 1.   An exposure or any part of an exposure fully secured by mortgage on immovable property shall be assigned a risk weight of 100 %, where the conditions set out in Article 125 or 126 are not met, except for any part of the exposure which is assigned to another exposure class. The part of the exposure that exceeds the mortgage value of the immovable property shall be assigned the risk weight applicable to the unsecured exposures of the counterparty involved.\nThe part of an exposure that is treated as fully secured by immovable property shall not be greater than the pledged amount of the market value or in those Member States that have laid down rigorous criteria for the assessment of the mortgage lending value in statutory or regulatory provisions, the mortgage lending value of the immovable property in question.\n1a.   Member States shall designate an authority to be responsible for the application of paragraph 2. That authority shall be the competent authority or the designated authority.\nWhere the authority designated by the Member State for the application of this Article is the competent authority, it shall ensure that the relevant national bodies and authorities which have a macroprudential mandate are duly informed of the competent authority's intention to make use of this Article, and are appropriately involved in the assessment of financial stability concerns in its Member State in accordance with paragraph 2. Where the authority designated by the Member State for the application of this Article is different from the competent authority, the Member State shall adopt the necessary provisions to ensure proper coordination and exchange of information between the competent authority and the designated authority for the proper application of this Article. In particular, authorities shall be required to cooperate closely and to share all the information that may be necessary for the adequate performance of the duties imposed upon the designated authority pursuant to this Article. That cooperation shall aim at avoiding any form of duplicative or inconsistent action between the competent authority and the designated authority, as well as ensuring that the interaction with other measures, in particular measures taken under Article 458 of this Regulation and Article 133 of Directive 2013/36/EU, is duly taken into account. 2.   Based on the data collected under Article 430a and on any other relevant indicators, the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 1a of this Article shall periodically, and at least annually, assess whether the risk weight of 35 % for exposures to one or more property segments secured by mortgages on residential property referred to in Article 125 located in one or more parts of the territory of the Member State of the relevant authority and the risk weight of 50 % for exposures secured by mortgages on commercial immovable property referred to in Article 126 located in one or more parts of the territory of the Member State of the relevant authority are appropriately based on:\n(a) the loss experience of exposures secured by immovable property;\n(b) forward-looking immovable property markets developments.\nWhere, on the basis of the assessment referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph, the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 1a of this Article concludes that the risk weights set out in Article 125(2) or 126(2) do not adequately reflect the actual risks related to exposures to one or more property segments fully secured by mortgages on residential property or on commercial immovable property located in one or more parts of the territory of the Member State of the relevant authority, and if it considers that the inadequacy of the risk weights could adversely affect current or future financial stability in its Member State, it may increase the risk weights applicable to those exposures within the ranges determined in the fourth subparagraph of this paragraph or impose stricter criteria than those set out in Article 125(2) or 126(2).\nThe authority designated in accordance with paragraph 1a of this Article shall notify EBA and the ESRB of any adjustments to risk weights and criteria applied pursuant to this paragraph. Within one month of receipt of that notification, EBA and the ESRB shall provide their opinion to the Member State concerned. EBA and the ESRB shall publish the risk weights and criteria for exposures referred to in Articles 125, 126 and point (a) of Article 199(1) as implemented by the relevant authority.\nFor the purposes of the second subparagraph of this paragraph, the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 1a may set the risk weights within the following ranges:\n(a) 35 % to 150 % for exposures secured by mortgages on residential property;\n(b) 50 % to 150 % for exposures secured by mortgages on commercial immovable property. 3.   Where the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 1a sets higher risk weights or stricter criteria pursuant to the second subparagraph of paragraph 2, institutions shall have a six-month transitional period to apply them. 4.   EBA, in close cooperation with the ESRB, shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the rigorous criteria for the assessment of the mortgage lending value referred to in paragraph 1 and the types of factors to be considered for the assessment of the appropriateness of the risk weights referred in the first subparagraph of paragraph 2. EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2019. Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. 5.   The ESRB may, by means of recommendations in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1092/2010, and in close cooperation with EBA, give guidance to authorities designated in accordance with paragraph 1a of this Article on the following:\n(a) factors which could \u2018adversely affect current or future financial stability\u2019 referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 2; and\n(b) indicative benchmarks that the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 1a is to take into account when determining higher risk weights. 6.   The institutions of a Member State shall apply the risk weights and criteria that have been determined by the authorities of another Member State in accordance with paragraph 2 to all their corresponding exposures secured by mortgages on residential property or commercial immovable property located in one or more parts of that Member State.\u2019;\n(61) in Article 128, paragraphs 1 and 2 are replaced by the following:\n\u20181.   Institutions shall assign a 150 % risk weight to exposures that are associated with particularly high risks. 2.   For the purposes of this Article, institutions shall treat any of the following exposures as exposures associated with particularly high risks:\n(a) investments in venture capital firms, except where those investments are treated in accordance with Article 132;\n(b) investments in private equity, except where those investments are treated in accordance with Article 132;\n(c) speculative immovable property financing.\u2019;\n(62) Article 132 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Article 132\nOwn funds requirements for exposures in the form of units or shares in CIUs 1.   Institutions shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount for their exposures in the form of units or shares in a CIU by multiplying the risk-weighted exposure amount of the CIU's exposures, calculated in accordance with the approaches referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 2, with the percentage of units or shares held by those institutions. 2.   Where the conditions set out in paragraph 3 of this Article are met, institutions may apply the look-through approach in accordance with Article 132a(1) or the mandate-based approach in accordance with Article 132a(2).\nSubject to Article 132b(2), institutions that do not apply the look-through approach or the mandate-based approach shall assign a risk weight of 1 250 % (\u2018fall-back approach\u2019) to their exposures in the form of units or shares in a CIU.\nInstitutions may calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount for their exposures in the form of units or shares in a CIU by using a combination of the approaches referred to in this paragraph, provided that the conditions for using those approaches are met. 3.   Institutions may determine the risk-weighted exposure amount of a CIU's exposures in accordance with the approaches set out in Article 132a where all the following conditions are met:\n(a) the CIU is one of the following:\n(i) an undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS), governed by Directive 2009/65/EC;\n(ii) an AIF managed by an EU AIFM registered under Article 3(3) of Directive 2011/61/EU;\n(iii) an AIF managed by an EU AIFM authorised under Article 6 of Directive 2011/61/EU;\n(iv) an AIF managed by a non-EU AIFM authorised under Article 37 of Directive 2011/61/EU;\n(v) a non-EU AIF managed by a non-EU AIFM and marketed in accordance with Article 42 of Directive 2011/61/EU;\n(vi) a non-EU AIF not marketed in the Union and managed by a non-EU AIFM established in a third country that is covered by a delegated act referred to in Article 67(6) of Directive 2011/61/EU;\n(b) the CIU's prospectus or equivalent document includes the following:\n(i) the categories of assets in which the CIU is authorised to invest;\n(ii) where investment limits apply, the relative limits and the methodologies to calculate them;\n(c) reporting by the CIU or the CIU management company to the institution complies with the following requirements:\n(i) the exposures of the CIU are reported at least as frequently as those of the institution;\n(ii) the granularity of the financial information is sufficient to allow the institution to calculate the CIU's risk -weighted exposure amount in accordance with the approach chosen by the institution;\n(iii) where the institution applies the look-through approach, information about the underlying exposures is verified by an independent third party.\nBy way of derogation from point (a) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, multilateral and bilateral development banks and other institutions that co-invest in a CIU with multilateral or bilateral development banks may determine the risk-weighted exposure amount of that CIU's exposures in accordance with the approaches set out in Article 132a, provided that the conditions set out in points (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph are met and that the CIU's investment mandate limits the types of assets that the CIU can invest in to assets that promote sustainable development in developing countries.\nInstitutions shall notify their competent authority of the CIUs to which they apply the treatment referred to in the second subparagraph.\nBy way of derogation from point (c)(i) of the first subparagraph, where the institution determines the risk-weighted exposure amount of a CIU's exposures in accordance with the mandate-based approach, the reporting by the CIU or the CIU management company to the institution may be limited to the investment mandate of the CIU and any changes thereof and may be done only when the institution incurs the exposure to the CIU for the first time and when there is a change in the investment mandate of the CIU. 4.   Institutions that do not have adequate data or information to calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount of a CIU's exposures in accordance with the approaches set out in Article 132a may rely on the calculations of a third party, provided that all the following conditions are met:\n(a) the third party is one of the following:\n(i) the depository institution or the depository financial institution of the CIU, provided that the CIU exclusively invests in securities and deposits all securities at that depository institution or depository financial institution;\n(ii) for CIUs not covered by point (i) of this point, the CIU management company, provided that the company meets the condition set out in point (a) of paragraph 3;\n(b) the third party carries out the calculation in accordance with the approaches set out in Article 132a(1), (2) or (3), as applicable;\n(c) an external auditor has confirmed the correctness of the third party's calculation.\nInstitutions that rely on third-party calculations shall multiply the risk-weighted exposure amount of a CIU's exposures resulting from those calculations by a factor of 1,2. By way of derogation from the second subparagraph, where the institution has unrestricted access to the detailed calculations carried out by the third party, the factor of 1,2 shall not apply. The institution shall provide those calculations to its competent authority upon request. 5.   Where an institution applies the approaches referred to in Article 132a for the purpose of calculating the risk-weighted exposure amount of a CIU's exposures (\u2018level 1 CIU\u2019), and any of the underlying exposures of the level 1 CIU is an exposure in the form of units or shares in another CIU (\u2018level 2 CIU\u2019), the risk-weighted exposure amount of the level 2 CIU's exposures may be calculated by using any of the three approaches described in paragraph 2 of this Article. The institution may use the look-through approach to calculate the risk-weighted exposure amounts of CIUs' exposures in level 3 and any subsequent level only where it used that approach for the calculation in the preceding level. In any other scenario it shall use the fall-back approach. 6.   The risk-weighted exposure amount of a CIU's exposures calculated in accordance with the look-through approach and the mandate-based approach set out in Article 132a(1) and (2) shall be capped at the risk-weighted amount of that CIU's exposures calculated in accordance with the fall-back approach. 7.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions that apply the look-through approach in accordance with Article 132a(1) may calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount for their exposures in the form of units or shares in a CIU by multiplying the exposure values of those exposures, calculated in accordance with Article 111, with the risk weight (\n) calculated in accordance with the formula set out in Article 132c, provided that the following conditions are met:\n(a) the institutions measure the value of their holdings of units or shares in a CIU at historical cost but measure the value of the underlying assets of the CIU at fair value if they apply the look-through approach;\n(b) a change in the market value of the units or shares for which institutions measure the value at historical cost changes neither the amount of own funds of those institutions nor the exposure value associated with those holdings.\u2019;\n(63) the following articles are inserted:\n\u2018Article 132a\nApproaches for calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts of CIUs 1.   Where the conditions set out in Article 132(3) are met, institutions that have sufficient information about the individual underlying exposures of a CIU shall look through to those exposures to calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount of the CIU, risk weighting all underlying exposures of the CIU as if they were directly held by those institutions. 2.   Where the conditions set out in Article 132(3) are met, institutions that do not have sufficient information about the individual underlying exposures of a CIU to use the look-through approach may calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount of those exposures in accordance with the limits set in the CIU's mandate and relevant law.\nInstitutions shall carry out the calculations referred to in the first subparagraph under the assumption that the CIU first incurs exposures to the maximum extent allowed under its mandate or relevant law in the exposures attracting the highest own funds requirement and then continues incurring exposures in descending order until the maximum total exposure limit is reached, and that the CIU applies leverage to the maximum extent allowed under its mandate or relevant law, where applicable.\nInstitutions shall carry out the calculations referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with the methods set out in this Chapter, in Chapter 5, and in Section 3, 4 or 5 of Chapter 6 of this Title. 3.   By way of derogation from point (d) of Article 92(3), institutions that calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount of a CIU's exposures in accordance with paragraph 1 or 2 of this Article may calculate the own funds requirement for the credit valuation adjustment risk of derivative exposures of that CIU as an amount equal to 50 % of the own funds requirement for those derivative exposures calculated in accordance with Section 3, 4 or 5 of Chapter 6 of this Title, as applicable.\nBy way of derogation from the first subparagraph, an institution may exclude from the calculation of the own funds requirement for credit valuation adjustment risk derivative exposures which would not be subject to that requirement if they were incurred directly by the institution. 4.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify how institutions shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount referred to in paragraph 2 where one or more of the inputs required for that calculation are not available.\nEBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 March 2020. Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. Article 132b\nExclusions from the approaches for calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts of CIUs 1.   Institutions may exclude from the calculations referred to in Article 132 Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1, Tier 2 instruments and eligible liabilities instruments held by a CIU which institutions shall deduct in accordance with Article 36(1) and Articles 56, 66 and 72e respectively. 2.   Institutions may exclude from the calculations referred to in Article 132 exposures in the form of units or shares in CIUs referred to in points (g) and (h) of Article 150(1) and instead apply the treatment set out in Article 133 to those exposures.\nArticle 132c\nTreatment of off-balance-sheet exposures to CIUs 1.   Institutions shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount for their off-balance-sheet items with the potential to be converted into exposures in the form of units or shares in a CIU by multiplying the exposure values of those exposures calculated in accordance with Article 111, with the following risk weight:\n(a) for all exposures for which institutions use one of the approaches set out in Article 132a:\nwhere:\n=\nthe risk weight;\ni\n=\nthe index denoting the CIU:\nRWAEi\n=\nthe amount calculated in accordance with Article 132a for a CIUi;\n=\nthe exposure value of the exposures of CIUi;\nAi\n=\nthe accounting value of assets of CIUi; and\nEQi\n=\nthe accounting value of the equity of CIUi.\n(b) for all other exposures, \n. 2.   Institutions shall calculate the exposure value of a minimum value commitment that meets the conditions set out in paragraph 3 of this Article as the discounted present value of the guaranteed amount using a default risk-free discount factor. Institutions may reduce the exposure value of the minimum value commitment by any losses recognised with respect to the minimum value commitment under the applicable accounting standard.\nInstitutions shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount for off-balance-sheet exposures arising from minimum value commitments that meet all the conditions set out in paragraph 3 of this Article by multiplying the exposure value of those exposures by a conversion factor of 20 % and the risk weight derived under Article 132 or 152. 3.   Institutions shall determine the risk-weighted exposure amount for off-balance-sheet exposures arising from minimum value commitments in accordance with paragraph 2 where all the following conditions are met:\n(a) the off-balance-sheet exposure of the institution is a minimum value commitment for an investment into units or shares of one or more CIUs under which the institution is only obliged to pay out under the minimum value commitment where the market value of the underlying exposures of the CIU or CIUs is below a predetermined threshold at one or more points in time, as specified in the contract;\n(b) the CIU is any of the following:\n(i) a UCITS as defined in Directive 2009/65/EC; or\n(ii) an AIF as defined in point (a) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2011/61/EU which solely invests in transferable securities or in other liquid financial assets referred to in Article 50(1) of Directive 2009/65/EC, where the mandate of the AIF does not allow a leverage higher than that allowed under Article 51(3) of Directive 2009/65/EC;\n(c) the current market value of the underlying exposures of the CIU underlying the minimum value commitment without considering the effect of the off-balance-sheet minimum value commitments covers or exceeds the present value of the threshold specified in the minimum value commitment;\n(d) when the excess of the market value of the underlying exposures of the CIU or CIUs over the present value of the minimum value commitment declines, the institution, or another undertaking in so far as it is covered by the supervision on a consolidated basis to which the institution itself is subject in accordance with this Regulation and Directive 2013/36/EU or Directive 2002/87/EC, can influence the composition of the underlying exposures of the CIU or CIUs or limit the potential for a further reduction of the excess in other ways;\n(e) the ultimate direct or indirect beneficiary of the minimum value commitment is typically a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU.\u2019;\n(64) in Article 144(1), point (g) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(g) the institution has calculated under the IRB Approach the own funds requirements resulting from its risk parameters estimates and is able to submit the reporting as required by Article 430;\u2019;\n(65) Article 152 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Article 152\nTreatment of exposures in the form of units or shares in CIUs 1.   Institutions shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amounts for their exposures in the form of units or shares in a CIU by multiplying the risk-weighted exposure amount of the CIU, calculated in accordance with the approaches set out in paragraphs 2 and 5, with the percentage of units or shares held by those institutions. 2.   Where the conditions set out in Article 132(3) are met, institutions that have sufficient information about the individual underlying exposures of a CIU shall look through to those underlying exposures to calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount of the CIU, risk weighting all underlying exposures of the CIU as if they were directly held by the institutions. 3.   By way of derogation from point (d) of Article 92(3), institutions that calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount of the CIU in accordance with paragraph 1 or 2 of this Article may calculate the own funds requirement for credit valuation adjustment risk of derivative exposures of that CIU as an amount equal to 50 % of the own funds requirement for those derivative exposures calculated in accordance with Section 3, 4 or 5 of Chapter 6 of this Title, as applicable.\nBy way of derogation from the first subparagraph, an institution may exclude from the calculation of the own funds requirement for credit valuation adjustment risk derivative exposures which would not be subject to that requirement if they were incurred directly by the institution. 4.   Institutions that apply the look-through approach in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article and that meet the conditions for permanent partial use in accordance with Article 150, or that do not meet the conditions for using the methods set out in this Chapter or one or more of the methods set out in Chapter 5 for all or parts of the underlying exposures of the CIU, shall calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts in accordance with the following principles:\n(a) for exposures assigned to the equity exposure class referred to in point (e) of Article 147(2), institutions shall apply the simple risk-weight approach set out in Article 155(2);\n(b) for exposures assigned to the items representing securitisation positions referred to in point (f) of Article 147(2), institutions shall apply the treatment set out in Article 254 as if those exposures were directly held by those institutions;\n(c) for all other underlying exposures, institutions shall apply the Standardised Approach laid down in Chapter 2 of this Title.\nFor the purposes of point (a) of the first subparagraph, where the institution is unable to differentiate between private equity exposures, exchange-traded exposures and other equity exposures, it shall treat the exposures concerned as other equity exposures. 5.   Where the conditions set out in Article 132(3) are met, institutions that do not have sufficient information about the individual underlying exposures of a CIU may calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount for those exposures in accordance with the mandate-based approach set out in Article 132a(2). However, for the exposures listed in points (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 4 of this Article, institutions shall apply the approaches set out therein. 6.   Subject to Article 132b(2), institutions that do not apply the look-through approach in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article or the mandate-based approach in accordance with paragraph 5 of this Article shall apply the fall-back approach referred to in Article 132(2). 7.   Institutions may calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount for their exposures in the form of units or shares in a CIU by using a combination of the approaches referred to in this Article, provided that the conditions for using those approaches are met. 8.   Institutions that do not have adequate data or information to calculate the risk-weighted amount of a CIU in accordance with the approaches set out in paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 5 may rely on the calculations of a third party, provided that all the following conditions are met:\n(a) the third party is one of the following:\n(i) the depository institution or the depository financial institution of the CIU, provided that the CIU exclusively invests in securities and deposits all securities at that depository institution or depository financial institution;\n(ii) for CIUs not covered by point (i) of this point, the CIU management company, provided that the CIU management company meets the criteria set out in point (a) of Article 132(3);\n(b) for exposures other than those listed in points (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 4 of this Article, the third party carries out the calculation in accordance with the look-through approach set out in Article 132a(1);\n(c) for exposures listed in points (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 4, the third party carries out the calculation in accordance with the approaches set out therein;\n(d) an external auditor has confirmed the correctness of the third party's calculation.\nInstitutions that rely on third-party calculations shall multiply the risk weighted exposure amounts of a CIU's exposures resulting from those calculations by a factor of 1,2. By way of derogation from the second subparagraph, where the institution has unrestricted access to the detailed calculations carried out by the third party, the 1,2 factor shall not apply. The institution shall provide those calculations to its competent authority upon request. 9.   For the purposes of this Article, Article 132(5) and (6) and Article 132b shall apply. For the purposes of this Article, Article 132c shall apply, using the risk weights calculated in accordance with Chapter 3 of this Title.\u2019;\n(66) in Article 158, the following paragraph is inserted:\n\u20189a.   The expected loss amount for a minimum value commitment that meets all the requirements set out in Article 132c(3) shall be zero.\u2019;\n(67) Article 164 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Article 164\nLoss Given Default (LGD) 1.   Institutions shall provide own estimates of LGDs subject to the requirements specified in Section 6 of this Chapter and permission of the competent authorities granted in accordance with Article 143. For dilution risk of purchased receivables, an LGD value of 75 % shall be used. If an institution can decompose its EL estimates for dilution risk of purchased receivables into PDs and LGDs in a reliable manner, the institution may use its own LGD estimate. 2.   Unfunded credit protection may be recognised as eligible by adjusting PD or LGD estimates subject to requirements as specified in Article 183(1), (2) and (3) and the permission of the competent authorities either in support of an individual exposure or a pool of exposures. An institution shall not assign guaranteed exposures an adjusted PD or LGD such that the adjusted risk weight would be lower than that of a comparable, direct exposure to the guarantor. 3.   For the purposes of Article 154(2), the LGD of a comparable direct exposure to the protection provider referred to in Article 153(3) shall either be the LGD associated with an unhedged facility to the guarantor or the unhedged facility of the obligor, depending upon whether, in the event both the guarantor and obligor default during the life of the hedged transaction, available evidence and the structure of the guarantee indicate that the amount recovered would depend on the financial condition of the guarantor or obligor, respectively. 4.   The exposure-weighted average LGD for all retail exposures secured by residential property and not benefiting from guarantees from central governments shall not be lower than 10 %.\nThe exposure-weighted average LGD for all retail exposures secured by commercial immovable property and not benefiting from guarantees from central governments shall not be lower than 15 %. 5.   Member States shall designate an authority to be responsible for the application of paragraph 6. That authority shall be the competent authority or the designated authority.\nWhere the authority designated by the Member State for the application of this Article is the competent authority, it shall ensure that the relevant national bodies and authorities which have a macroprudential mandate are duly informed of the competent authority's intention to make use of this Article, and are appropriately involved in the assessment of financial stability concerns in its Member State in accordance with paragraph 6. Where the authority designated by the Member State for the application of this Article is different from the competent authority, the Member State shall adopt the necessary provisions to ensure proper coordination and exchange of information between the competent authority and the designated authority for the proper application of this Article. In particular, authorities shall be required to cooperate closely and to share all the information that may be necessary for the adequate performance of the duties imposed upon the designated authority pursuant to this Article. That cooperation shall aim at avoiding any form of duplicative or inconsistent action between the competent authority and the designated authority, as well as ensuring that the interaction with other measures, in particular measures taken under Article 458 of this Regulation and Article 133 of Directive 2013/36/EU, is duly taken into account. 6.   Based on the data collected under Article 430a and on any other relevant indicators, and taking into account forward-looking immovable property market developments the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 5 of this Article shall periodically, and at least annually, assess whether the minimum LGD values referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article, are appropriate for exposures secured by mortgages on residential property or commercial immovable property located in one or more parts of the territory of the Member State of the relevant authority.\nWhere, on the basis of the assessment referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph, the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 5 concludes that the minimum LGD values referred to in paragraph 4 are not adequate, and if it considers that the inadequacy of LGD values could adversely affect current or future financial stability in its Member State, it may set higher minimum LGD values for those exposures located in one or more parts of the territory of the Member State of the relevant authority. Those higher minimum values may also be applied at the level of one or more property segments of such exposures.\nThe authority designated in accordance with paragraph 5 shall notify EBA and the ESRB before making the decision referred to in this paragraph. Within one month of receipt of that notification EBA and the ESRB shall provide their opinion to the Member State concerned. EBA and the ESRB shall publish those LGD values. 7.   Where the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 5 sets higher minimum LGD values pursuant to paragraph 6, institutions shall have a six-month transitional period to apply them. 8.   EBA, in close cooperation with the ESRB, shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the conditions that the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 5 shall take into account when assessing the appropriateness of LGD values as part of the assessment referred to in paragraph 6. EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2019. Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. 9.   The ESRB may, by means of recommendations in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1092/2010, and in close cooperation with EBA, give guidance to authorities designated in accordance with paragraph 5 of this Article on the following:\n(a) factors which could \u2018adversely affect current or future financial stability\u2019 referred to in paragraph 6; and\n(b) indicative benchmarks that the authority designated in accordance with paragraph 5 is to take into account when determining higher minimum LGD values. 10.   The institutions of a Member State shall apply the higher minimum LGD values that have been determined by the authorities of another Member State in accordance with paragraph 6 to all their corresponding exposures secured by mortgages on residential property or commercial immovable property located in one or more parts of that Member State.\u2019;\n(68) in Article 201(1), point (h) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(h) qualifying central counterparties.\u2019;\n(69) the following article is inserted:\n\u2018Article 204a\nEligible types of equity derivatives 1.   Institutions may use equity derivatives which are total return swaps or economically effectively similar, as eligible credit protection only for the purpose of conducting internal hedges.\nWhere an institution buys credit protection through a total return swap and records the net payments received on the swap as net income, but does not record the offsetting deterioration in the value of the asset that is protected either through reductions in fair value or by an addition to reserves, that credit protection shall not qualify as eligible credit protection. 2.   Where an institution conducts an internal hedge using an equity derivative, in order for the internal hedge to qualify as eligible credit protection for the purposes of this Chapter, the credit risk transferred to the trading book shall be transferred out to a third party or parties.\nWhere an internal hedge has been conducted in accordance with the first subparagraph and the requirements in this Chapter have been met, institutions shall apply the rules set out in Sections 4 to 6 of this Chapter for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts where they acquire unfunded credit protection.\u2019;\n(70) Article 223 is amended as follows:\n(a) in paragraph 3, the second subparagraph is replaced by the following:\n                                             \u2018In the case of OTC derivative transactions, institutions using the method laid down in Section 6 of Chapter 6 shall calculate EVA as follows:\n \nEVA = E.\u2019;\n(b) in paragraph 5, the following subparagraph is added:\n\u2018In the case of OTC derivative transactions, institutions using the methods laid down in Sections 3, 4 and 5 of Chapter 6 shall take into account the risk-mitigating effects of collateral in accordance with the provisions laid down in Sections 3, 4 and 5 of Chapter 6, as applicable.\u2019;\n(71) Article 272 is amended as follows:\n(a) point (6) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(6) \u2018hedging set\u2019 means a group of transactions within a single netting set for which full or partial offsetting is allowed for determining the potential future exposure under the methods set out in Section 3 or 4 of this Chapter;\u2019;\n(b) the following point is inserted:\n\u2018(7a)\n\u2018one way margin agreement\u2019 means a margin agreement under which an institution is required to post variation margin to a counterparty but is not entitled to receive variation margin from that counterparty or vice-versa;\u2019;\n(c) point (12) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(12) \u2018current market value\u2019 or \u2018CMV\u2019 means the net market value of all the transactions within a netting set gross of any collateral held or posted where positive and negative market values are netted in computing the CMV;\u2019\n(d) the following point is inserted:\n\u2018(12a)\n\u2018net independent collateral amount\u2019 or \u2018NICA\u2019 means the sum of the volatility-adjusted value of net collateral received or posted, as applicable, to the netting set other than variation margin;\u2019;\n(72) Article 273 is amended as follows:\n(a) paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:\n\u20181.   Institutions shall calculate the exposure value for the contracts listed in Annex II on the basis of one of the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 in accordance with this Article.\nAn institution which does not meet the conditions set out in Article 273a(1) shall not use the method set out in Section 4. An institution which does not meet the conditions set out in Article 273a(2) shall not use the method set out in Section 5. Institutions may use in combination the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 on a permanent basis within a group. A single institution shall not use in combination the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 on a permanent basis.\u2019;\n(b) paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 are replaced by the following:\n\u20186.   Under the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6, the exposure value for a given counterparty shall be equal to the sum of the exposure values calculated for each netting set with that counterparty.\nBy way of derogation from the first subparagraph, where one margin agreement applies to multiple netting sets with that counterparty and the institution is using one of the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 to calculate the exposure value of those netting sets, the exposure value shall be calculated in accordance with the relevant Section.\nFor a given counterparty, the exposure value for a given netting set of OTC derivative instruments listed in Annex II calculated in accordance with this Chapter shall be the greater of zero and the difference between the sum of exposure values across all netting sets with the counterparty and the sum of credit valuation adjustments for that counterparty being recognised by the institution as an incurred write-down. The credit valuation adjustments shall be calculated without taking into account any offsetting debit value adjustment attributed to the own credit risk of the firm that has been already excluded from own funds in accordance with point (c) of Article 33(1). 7.   In calculating the exposure value in accordance with the methods set out in Sections 3, 4 and 5, institutions may treat two OTC derivative contracts included in the same netting agreement that are perfectly matching as if they were a single contract with a notional principal equal to zero.\nFor the purposes of the first subparagraph, two OTC derivative contracts are perfectly matching when they meet all the following conditions:\n(a) their risk positions are opposite;\n(b) their features, with the exception of the trade date, are identical;\n(c) their cash flows fully offset each other. 8.   Institutions shall determine the exposure value for exposures arising from long settlement transactions by any of the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 of this Chapter, regardless of which method the institution has chosen for treating OTC derivatives and repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, and margin lending transactions. In calculating the own funds requirements for long settlement transactions, an institution that uses the approach set out in Chapter 3 may assign the risk weights under the approach set out in Chapter 2 on a permanent basis and irrespective of the materiality of those positions.\u2019;\n(c) the following paragraph is added:\n\u20189.   For the methods set out in Sections 3 to 6 of this Chapter, institutions shall treat transactions where Specific Wrong-Way risk has been identified in accordance with Article 291(2), (4), (5), and (6).\u2019;\n(73) the following articles are inserted:\n\u2018Article 273a\nConditions for using simplified methods for calculating the exposure value 1.   An institution may calculate the exposure value of its derivative positions in accordance with the method set out in Section 4, provided that the size of its on- and off-balance-sheet derivative business is equal to or less than both of the following thresholds on the basis of an assessment carried out on a monthly basis using the data as of the last day of the month:\n(a) 10 % of the institution's total assets;\n(b) EUR 300 million. 2.   An institution may calculate the exposure value of its derivative positions in accordance with the method set out in Section 5, provided that the size of its on- and off-balance-sheet derivative business is equal to or less than both of the following thresholds on the basis of an assessment carried out on a monthly basis using the data as of the last day of the month:\n(a) 5 % of the institution's total assets;\n(b) EUR 100 million. 3.   For the purposes of paragraphs 1 and 2, institutions shall calculate the size of their on- and off-balance-sheet derivative business on the basis of data as of the last day of each month in accordance with the following requirements:\n(a) derivative positions shall be valued at their market values on that given date; where the market value of a position is not available on a given date, institutions shall take a fair value for the position on that date; where the market value and fair value of a position are not available on a given date, institutions shall take the most recent of the market value or fair value for that position;\n(b) the absolute value of long derivative positions shall be summed with the absolute value of short derivative positions;\n(c) all derivative positions shall be included, except credit derivatives that are recognised as internal hedges against non-trading book credit risk exposures. 4.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1 or 2, as applicable, where the derivative business on a consolidated basis does not exceed the thresholds set out in paragraph 1 or 2, as applicable, an institution which is included in the consolidation and which would have to apply the method set out in Section 3 or 4 because it exceeds those thresholds on an individual basis, may, subject to the approval of competent authorities, instead choose to apply the method that would apply on a consolidated basis. 5.   Institutions shall notify the competent authorities of the methods set out in Section 4 or 5 that they use, or cease to use, as applicable, to calculate the exposure value of their derivative positions. 6.   Institutions shall not enter into a derivative transaction or buy or sell a derivative instrument for the sole purpose of complying with any of the conditions set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 during the monthly assessment.\nArticle 273b\nNon-compliance with the conditions for using simplified methods for calculating the exposure value of derivatives 1.   An institution that no longer meets one or more of the conditions set out in Article 273a(1) or (2) shall immediately notify the competent authority thereof. 2.   An institution shall cease to calculate the exposure values of its derivative positions in accordance with Section 4 or 5, as applicable, within three months of one of the following occurring:\n(a) the institution does not meet the conditions set out in point (a) of Article 273a(1) or (2), as applicable, or the conditions set out in point (b) of Article 273a(1) or (2), as applicable, for three consecutive months;\n(b) the institution does not meet the conditions set out in point (a) of Article 273a(1) or (2), as applicable, or the conditions set out in point (b) of Article 273a(1) or (2), as applicable, for more than six of the preceding 12 months. 3.   Where an institution has ceased to calculate the exposure values of its derivative positions in accordance with Section 4 or 5, as applicable, it shall only be permitted to resume calculating the exposure value of its derivative positions as set out in Section 4 or 5 where it demonstrates to the competent authority that all the conditions set out in Article 273a(1) or (2) have been met for an uninterrupted period of one year.\u2019;\n(74) in Chapter 6 of Title II of Part Three, Sections 3, 4 and 5 are replaced by the following:\n                                       \u2018\n                                       Section 3\nStandardised approach for counterparty credit risk\nArticle 274\nExposure value 1.   An institution may calculate a single exposure value at netting set level for all the transactions covered by a contractual netting agreement where all the following conditions are met:\n(a) the netting agreement belongs to one of the types of contractual netting agreements referred to in Article 295;\n(b) the netting agreement has been recognised by competent authorities in accordance with Article 296;\n(c) the institution has fulfilled the obligations laid down in Article 297 in respect of the netting agreement.\nWhere any of the conditions set out in the first subparagraph are not met, the institution shall treat each transaction as if it was its own netting set. 2.   Institutions shall calculate the exposure value of a netting set under the standardised approach for counterparty credit risk as follows:\n \nExposure value = \u03b1 \u0387 (RC + PFE)\nwhere:\nRC\n=\nthe replacement cost calculated in accordance with Article 275; and\nPFE\n=\nthe potential future exposure calculated in accordance with Article 278;\n\u03b1\n=\n1,4. 3.   The exposure value of a netting set that is subject to a contractual margin agreement shall be capped at the exposure value of the same netting set not subject to any form of margin agreement. 4.   Where multiple margin agreements apply to the same netting set, institutions shall allocate each margin agreement to the group of transactions in the netting set to which that margin agreement contractually applies to and calculate an exposure value separately for each of those grouped transactions. 5.   Institutions may set to zero the exposure value of a netting set that satisfies all the following conditions:\n(a) the netting set is solely composed of sold options;\n(b) the current market value of the netting set is at all times negative;\n(c) the premium of all the options included in the netting set has been received upfront by the institution to guarantee the performance of the contracts;\n(d) the netting set is not subject to any margin agreement. 6.   In a netting set, institutions shall replace a transaction which is a finite linear combination of bought or sold call or put options with all the single options that form that linear combination, taken as an individual transaction, for the purpose of calculating the exposure value of the netting set in accordance with this Section. Each such combination of options shall be treated as an individual transaction in the netting set in which the combination is included for the purpose of calculating the exposure value. 7.   The exposure value of a credit derivative transaction representing a long position in the underlying may be capped to the amount of outstanding unpaid premium provided it is treated as its own netting set that is not subject to a margin agreement.\nArticle 275\nReplacement cost 1.   Institutions shall calculate the replacement cost RC for netting sets that are not subject to a margin agreement, in accordance with the following formula:\n \nRC = max{CMV \u2013 NICA, 0} 2.   Institutions shall calculate the replacement cost for single netting sets that are subject to a margin agreement in accordance with the following formula:\n \nRC = max{CMV \u2013 VM \u2013 NICA, TH + MTA \u2013 NICA, 0}\nwhere:\nRC\n=\nthe replacement cost;\nVM\n=\nthe volatility-adjusted value of the net variation margin received or posted, as applicable, to the netting set on a regular basis to mitigate changes in the netting set's CMV;\nTH\n=\nthe margin threshold applicable to the netting set under the margin agreement below which the institution cannot call for collateral; and\nMTA\n=\nthe minimum transfer amount applicable to the netting set under the margin agreement. 3.   Institutions shall calculate the replacement cost for multiple netting sets that are subject to the same margin agreement in accordance with the following formula:\nwhere:\nRC\n=\nthe replacement cost;\ni\n=\nthe index that denotes the netting sets that are subject to the single margin agreement;\nCMVi\n=\nthe CMV of netting set i;\nVMMA\n=\nthe sum of the volatility-adjusted value of collateral received or posted, as applicable, to multiple netting sets on a regular basis to mitigate changes in their CMV; and\nNICAMA\n=\nthe sum of the volatility-adjusted value of collateral received or posted, as applicable, to multiple netting sets other than VMMA.\nFor the purposes of the first subparagraph, NICAMA may be calculated at trade level, at netting set level or at the level of all the netting sets to which the margin agreement applies depending on the level at which the margin agreement applies.\nArticle 276\nRecognition and treatment of collateral 1.   For the purposes of this Section, institutions shall calculate the collateral amounts of VM, VMMA, NICA and NICAMA, by applying all the following requirements:\n(a) where all the transactions included in a netting set belong to the trading book, only collateral that is eligible under Articles 197 and 299 shall be recognised;\n(b) where a netting set contains at least one transaction that belongs to the non-trading book, only collateral that is eligible under Article 197 shall be recognised;\n(c) collateral received from a counterparty shall be recognised with a positive sign and collateral posted to a counterparty shall be recognised with a negative sign;\n(d) the volatility-adjusted value of any type of collateral received or posted shall be calculated in accordance with Article 223; for the purposes of that calculation, institutions shall not use the method set out in Article 225;\n(e) the same collateral item shall not be included in both VM and NICA at the same time;\n(f) the same collateral item shall not be included in both VMMA and NICAMA at the same time;\n(g) any collateral posted to the counterparty that is segregated from the assets of that counterparty and, as a result of that segregation, is bankruptcy remote in the event of the default or insolvency of that counterparty shall not be recognised in the calculation of NICA and NICAMA. 2.   For the calculation of the volatility-adjusted value of collateral posted referred to in point (d) of paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions shall replace the formula set out in Article 223(2) with the following formula:\n \nCVA = C \u0387 (1 + HC + Hfx)\nwhere:\n \nCVA = the volatility-adjusted value of collateral posted; and\n \nC = the collateral;\n \nHc and Hfx are defined in accordance with Article 223(2). 3.   For the purposes of point (d) of paragraph 1, institutions shall set the liquidation period relevant for the calculation of the volatility-adjusted value of any collateral received or posted in accordance with one of the following time horizons:\n(a) one year for the netting sets referred to in Article 275(1);\n(b) the margin period of risk determined in accordance with point (b) of Article 279c(1) for the netting sets referred to in Article 275(2) and (3).\nArticle 277\nMapping of transactions to risk categories 1.   Institutions shall map each transaction of a netting set to one of the following risk categories to determine the potential future exposure of the netting set referred to in Article 278:\n(a) interest rate risk;\n(b) foreign exchange risk;\n(c) credit risk;\n(d) equity risk;\n(e) commodity risk;\n(f) other risks. 2.   Institutions shall conduct the mapping referred to in paragraph 1 on the basis of the primary risk driver of a derivative transaction. The primary risk driver shall be the only material risk driver of a derivative transaction. 3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 2, institutions shall map derivative transactions that have more than one material risk driver to more than one risk category. Where all the material risk drivers of one of those transactions belong to the same risk category, institutions shall only be required to map that transaction once to that risk category on the basis of the most material of those risk drivers. Where the material risk drivers of one of those transactions belong to different risk categories, institutions shall map that transaction once to each risk category for which the transaction has at least one material risk driver, on the basis of the most material of the risk drivers in that risk category. 4.   Notwithstanding paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, when mapping transactions to the risk categories listed in paragraph 1, institutions shall apply the following requirements:\n(a) where the primary risk driver of a transaction, or the most material risk driver in a given risk category for transactions referred to in paragraph 3, is an inflation variable, institutions shall map the transaction to the interest rate risk category;\n(b) where the primary risk driver of a transaction, or the most material risk driver in a given risk category for transactions referred to in paragraph 3, is a climatic conditions variable, institutions shall map the transaction to the commodity risk category. 5.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:\n(a) the method for identifying transactions with only one material risk driver;\n(b) the method for identifying transactions with more than one material risk driver and for identifying the most material of those risk drivers for the purposes of paragraph 3. EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 December 2019. Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. Article 277a\nHedging sets 1.   Institutions shall establish the relevant hedging sets for each risk category of a netting set and assign each transaction to those hedging sets as follows:\n(a) transactions mapped to the interest rate risk category shall be assigned to the same hedging set only where their primary risk driver, or the most material risk driver in the given risk category for transactions referred to in Article 277(3), is denominated in the same currency;\n(b) transactions mapped to the foreign exchange risk category shall be assigned to the same hedging set only where their primary risk driver, or the most material risk driver in the given risk category for transactions referred to in Article 277(3), is based on the same currency pair;\n(c) all the transactions mapped to the credit risk category shall be assigned to the same hedging set;\n(d) all the transactions mapped to the equity risk category shall be assigned to the same hedging set;\n(e) transactions mapped to the commodity risk category shall be assigned to one of the following hedging sets on the basis of the nature of their primary risk driver or the most material risk driver in the given risk category for transactions referred to in Article 277(3):\n(i) energy;\n(ii) metals;\n(iii) agricultural goods;\n(iv) other commodities;\n(v) climatic conditions;\n(f) transactions mapped to the other risks category shall be assigned to the same hedging set only where their primary risk driver, or the most material risk driver in the given risk category for transactions referred to in Article 277(3), is identical.\nFor the purposes of point (a) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, transactions mapped to the interest rate risk category that have an inflation variable as the primary risk driver shall be assigned to separate hedging sets, other than the hedging sets established for transactions mapped to the interest rate risk category that do not have an inflation variable as the primary risk driver. Those transactions shall be assigned to the same hedging set only where their primary risk driver, or the most material risk driver in the given risk category for transactions referred to in Article 277(3), is denominated in the same currency. 2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions shall establish separate individual hedging sets in each risk category for the following transactions:\n(a) transactions for which the primary risk driver, or the most material risk driver in the given risk category for transactions referred to in Article 277(3), is either the market implied volatility or the realised volatility of a risk driver or the correlation between two risk drivers;\n(b) transactions for which the primary risk driver, or the most material risk driver in the given risk category for transactions referred to in Article 277(3), is the difference between two risk drivers mapped to the same risk category or transactions that consist of two payment legs denominated in the same currency and for which a risk driver from the same risk category of the primary risk driver is contained in the other payment leg than the one containing the primary risk driver.\nFor the purposes of point (a) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, institutions shall assign transactions to the same hedging set of the relevant risk category only where their primary risk driver, or the most material risk driver in the given risk category for transactions referred to in Article 277(3), is identical.\nFor the purposes of point (b) of the first subparagraph, institutions shall assign transactions to the same hedging set of the relevant risk category only where the pair of risk drivers in those transactions as referred to therein is identical and the two risk drivers contained in this pair are positively correlated. Otherwise, institutions shall assign transactions referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph to one of the hedging sets established in accordance with paragraph 1, on the basis of only one of the two risk drivers referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph. 3.   Institutions shall make available upon request by the competent authorities the number of hedging sets established in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article for each risk category, with the primary risk driver, or the most material risk driver in the given risk category for transactions referred to in Article 277(3), or the pair of risk drivers of each of those hedging sets and with the number of transactions in each of those hedging sets.\nArticle 278\nPotential future exposure 1.   Institutions shall calculate the potential future exposure of a netting set as follows:\nwhere:\nPFE\n=\nthe potential future exposure;\na\n=\nthe index that denotes the risk categories included in the calculation of the potential future exposure of the netting set;\nAddOn(a) =\nthe add-on for risk category a calculated in accordance with Articles 280a to 280f, as applicable; and\nmultiplier\n=\nthe multiplication factor calculated in accordance with the formula referred to in paragraph 3. For the purpose of this calculation, institutions shall include the add-on of a given risk category in the calculation of the potential future exposure of a netting set where at least one transaction of the netting set has been mapped to that risk category. 2.   The potential future exposure of multiple netting sets that are subject to one margin agreement, as referred in Article 275(3), shall be calculated as the sum of the potential future exposures of all the individual netting sets as if they were not subject to any form of a margin agreement. 3.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, the multiplier shall be calculated as follows:\nmultiplier =\n \n1 if z \u2265 0\n if \nwhere:\n \nFloorm = 5 %;\n \ny = 2 \u0387 (1 \u2013 Floorm) \u0387 \u03a3aAddOn(a) z =\n \nCMV \u2013 NICA for the netting sets referred to in Article 275(1) CMV \u2013 VM \u2013 NICA for the netting sets referred to in Article 275(2) CMVi \u2013 NICAi for the netting sets referred to in Article 275(3) NICAi\n=\nthe net independent collateral amount calculated only for transactions that are included in netting set i.

Article 279b\nAdjusted notional amount 1.   Institutions shall calculate the adjusted notional amount as follows:\n(a) for transactions mapped to the interest rate risk category or the credit risk category, institutions shall calculate the adjusted notional amount as the product of the notional amount of the derivative contract and the supervisory duration factor, which shall be calculated as follows:\nwhere:\nR\n=\nthe supervisory discount rate; R = 5 %;\nS\n=\nthe period between the start date of a transaction and the reporting date, which shall be expressed in years using the relevant business day convention; and\nE\n=\nthe period between the end date of a transaction and the reporting date, which shall be expressed in years using the relevant business day convention.\nThe start date of a transaction is the earliest date at which at least a contractual payment under the transaction, to or from the institution, is either fixed or exchanged, other than payments related to the exchange of collateral in a margin agreement. Where the transaction has already been fixing or making payments at the reporting date, the start date of a transaction shall be equal to 0. Where a transaction involves one or more contractual future dates on which the institution or the counterparty may decide to terminate the transaction prior to its contractual maturity, the start date of a transaction shall be equal to the earliest of the following:\n(i) the date or the earliest of the multiple future dates at which the institution or the counterparty may decide to terminate the transaction earlier than its contractual maturity;\n(ii) the date at which a transaction starts fixing or making payments, other than payments related to the exchange of collateral in a margin agreement.\nWhere a transaction has a financial instrument as the underlying instrument that may give rise to contractual obligations additional to those of the transaction, the start date of a transaction shall be determined on the basis of the earliest date at which the underlying instrument starts fixing or making payments.\nThe end date of a transaction is the latest date at which a contractual payment under the transaction, to or from the institution, is or may be exchanged.\nWhere a transaction has a financial instrument as an underlying instrument that may give rise to contractual obligations additional to those of the transaction, the end date of a transaction shall be determined on the basis of the last contractual payment of the underlying instrument of the transaction.\nWhere a transaction is structured to settle an outstanding exposure following specified payment dates and where the terms are reset so that the market value of the transaction is zero on those specified dates, the settlement of the outstanding exposure at those specified dates is considered a contractual payment under the same transaction;\n(b) for transactions mapped to the foreign exchange risk category, institutions shall calculate the adjusted notional amount as follows:\n(i) where the transaction consists of one payment leg, the adjusted notional amount shall be the notional amount of the derivative contract;\n(ii) where the transaction consists of two payment legs and the notional amount of one payment leg is denominated in the institution's reporting currency, the adjusted notional amount shall be the notional amount of the other payment leg;\n(iii) where the transaction consists of two payment legs and the notional amount of each payment leg is denominated in a currency other than the institution's reporting currency, the adjusted notional amount shall be the largest of the notional amounts of the two payment legs after those amounts have been converted into the institution's reporting currency at the prevailing spot exchange rate;\n(c) for transactions mapped to the equity risk category or commodity risk category, institutions shall calculate the adjusted notional amount as the product of the market price of one unit of the underlying instrument of the transaction and the number of units in the underlying instrument referenced by the transaction;\nwhere a transaction mapped to the equity risk category or commodity risk category is contractually expressed as a notional amount, institutions shall use the notional amount of the transaction rather than the number of units in the underlying instrument as the adjusted notional amount;\n(d) for transactions mapped to the other risks category, institutions shall calculate the adjusted notional amount on the basis of the most appropriate method among the methods set out in points (a), (b) and (c), depending on the nature and characteristics of the underlying instrument of the transaction. 2.   Institutions shall determine the notional amount or number of units of the underlying instrument for the purpose of calculating the adjusted notional amount of a transaction referred to in paragraph 1 as follows:\n(a) where the notional amount or the number of units of the underlying instrument of a transaction is not fixed until its contractual maturity:\n(i) for deterministic notional amounts and numbers of units of the underlying instrument, the notional amount shall be the weighted average of all the deterministic values of notional amounts or number of units of the underlying instrument, as applicable, until the contractual maturity of the transaction, where the weights are the proportion of the time period during which each value of notional amount applies;\n(ii) for stochastic notional amounts and numbers of units of the underlying instrument, the notional amount shall be the amount determined by fixing current market values within the formula for calculating the future market values;\n(b) for contracts with multiple exchanges of the notional amount, the notional amount shall be multiplied by the number of remaining payments still to be made in accordance with the contracts;\n(c) for contracts that provide for a multiplication of the cash-flow payments or a multiplication of the underlying of the derivative contract, the notional amount shall be adjusted by an institution to take into account the effects of the multiplication on the risk structure of those contracts. 3.   Institutions shall convert the adjusted notional amount of a transaction into their reporting currency at the prevailing spot exchange rate where the adjusted notional amount is calculated under this Article from a contractual notional amount or a market price of the number of units of the underlying instrument denominated in another currency.\nArticle 279c\nMaturity Factor 1.   Institutions shall calculate the maturity factor as follows:\n(a) for transactions included in the netting sets referred to in Article 275(1), institutions shall use the following formula:\nwhere:\nMF\n=\nthe maturity factor;\nM\n=\nthe remaining maturity of the transaction which is equal to the period of time needed for the termination of all contractual obligations of the transaction; for that purpose, any optionality of a derivative contract shall be considered to be a contractual obligation; the remaining maturity shall be expressed in years using the relevant business day convention;\nwhere a transaction has another derivative contract as underlying instrument that may give rise to additional contractual obligations beyond the contractual obligations of the transaction, the remaining maturity of the transaction shall be equal to the period of time needed for the termination of all contractual obligations of the underlying instrument;\nwhere a transaction is structured to settle outstanding exposure following specified payment dates and where the terms are reset so that the market value of the transaction is zero on those specified dates, the remaining maturity of the transaction shall be equal to the time until the next reset date; and\nOneBusinessYear\n=\none year expressed in business days using the relevant business day convention;\n(b) for transactions included in the netting sets referred to in Article 275(2) and (3), the maturity factor is defined as:\nwhere:\nMF\n=\nthe maturity factor;\nMPOR\n=\nthe margin period of risk of the netting set determined in accordance with Article 285(2) to (5); and\nOneBusinessYear\n=\none year expressed in business days using the relevant business day convention.\nWhen determining the margin period of risk for transactions between a client and a clearing member, an institution acting either as the client or as the clearing member shall replace the minimum period set out in point (b) of Article 285(2) with five business days. 2.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, the remaining maturity shall be equal to the period of time until the next reset date for transactions that are structured to settle outstanding exposure following specified payment dates and where the terms are reset in such a way that the market value of the contract shall be zero on those specified payment dates.\nArticle 280\nHedging set supervisory factor coefficient\nFor the purpose of calculating the add-on of a hedging set as referred to in Articles 280a to 280f, the hedging set supervisory factor coefficient \u2018\u0454\u2019 shall be the following:\n \u0454 =\n \n1 for the hedging sets established in accordance with Article 277a(1) 5 for the hedging sets established in accordance with point (a) of Article 277a(2) 0,5 for the hedging sets established in accordance with point (b) of Article 277a(2) Article 280a\nInterest rate risk category add-on 1.

The current replacement cost referred to in paragraph 2 shall be calculated as follows:\n(a) for netting sets of transactions: that are traded on a recognised exchange; centrally cleared by a central counterparty authorised in accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 or recognised in accordance with Article 25 of that Regulation; or for which collateral is exchanged bilaterally with the counterparty in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, institutions shall use the following formula:\nRC = TH + MTA\nwhere:\nRC\n=\nthe replacement cost;\nTH\n=\nthe margin threshold applicable to the netting set under the margin agreement below which the institution cannot call for collateral; and\nMTA\n=\nthe minimum transfer amount applicable to the netting set under the margin agreement;\n(b) for all other netting sets or individual transactions, institutions shall use the following formula:\nRC = max{CMV, 0}\nwhere:\nRC\n=\nthe replacement cost; and\nCMV\n=\nthe current market value.\nIn order to calculate the current replacement cost, institutions shall update current market values at least monthly. 4.   Institutions shall calculate the potential future exposure referred to in paragraph 2 as follows:\n(a) the potential future exposure of a netting set is the sum of the potential future exposure of all the transactions included in the netting set, calculated in accordance with point (b);\n(b) the potential future exposure of a single transaction is its notional amount multiplied by:\n(i) the product of 0,5 % and the residual maturity of the transaction expressed in years for interest-rate derivative contracts;\n(ii) the product of 6 % and the residual maturity of the transaction expressed in years for credit derivative contracts;\n(iii) 4 % for foreign-exchange derivatives;\n(iv) 18 % for gold and commodity derivatives other than electricity derivatives;\n(v) 40 % for electricity derivatives;\n(vi) 32 % for equity derivatives;\n(c) the notional amount referred to in point (b) of this paragraph shall be determined in accordance with Article 279b(2) and (3) for all derivatives listed in that point; in addition, the notional amount of the derivatives referred to in points (b)(iii) to (b)(vi) of this paragraph shall be determined in accordance with points (b) and (c) of Article 279b(1);\n(d) the potential future exposure of netting sets referred to in point (a) of paragraph 3 shall be multiplied by 0,42. For calculating the potential exposure of interest-rate derivatives and credit derivatives in accordance with points b(i) and (b)(ii), an institution may choose to use the original maturity instead of the residual maturity of the contracts.\u2019;\n(75) in Article 283, paragraph 4 is replaced by the following:\n\u20184.   For all OTC derivative transactions, and for long settlement transactions for which an institution has not received permission under paragraph 1 to use the IMM, the institution shall use the methods set out in Section 3.

By way of derogation from point (i) of Article 281(2), where an institution that acts as a clearing member uses the method set out in Section 4 to calculate the own funds requirement for its exposures to a client, the institution may use a maturity factor of 0,21 for its calculation. 5.   By way of derogation from point (d) of Article 282(4), where an institution that acts as a clearing member uses the method set out in Section 5 to calculate the own funds requirement for its exposures to a client, that institution may use a maturity factor of 0,21 in that calculation.\u2019;\n(c) the following paragraphs are added:\n\u20186.

The alternative standardised approach as set out in this Chapter shall be used only for the purposes of the reporting requirement laid down in Article 430b(1). 2.   Institutions shall calculate the own funds requirements for market risk in accordance with the alternative standardised approach for a portfolio of trading book positions or non-trading book positions that are subject to foreign exchange or commodity risk as the sum of the following three components:\n(a) the own funds requirement under the sensitivities-based method set out in Section 2;\n(b) the own funds requirement for the default risk set out in Section 5 which is only applicable to the trading book positions referred to in that Section;\n(c) the own funds requirement for residual risks set out in Section 4 which is only applicable to the trading book positions referred to in that Section.\nSection 2\nSensitivities-based method for calculating the own funds requirement\nArticle 325d\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Chapter, the following definitions apply:\n(1) \u2018risk class\u2019 means one of the following seven categories:\n(i) general interest rate risk;\n(ii) credit spread risk (CSR) for non-securitisation;\n(iii) credit spread risk for securitisation not included in the alternative correlation trading portfolio (non-ACTP CSR);\n(iv) credit spread risk for securitisation included in the alternative correlation trading portfolio (ACTP CSR);\n(v) equity risk;\n(vi) commodity risk;\n(vii) foreign exchange risk;\n(2) \u2018sensitivity\u2019 means the relative change in the value of a position, as a result of a change in the value of one of the relevant risk factors of the position, calculated with the institution's pricing model in accordance with Subsection 2 of Section 3;\n(3) \u2018bucket\u2019 means a sub-category of positions within one risk class with a similar risk profile to which a risk weight as defined in Subsection 1 of Section 3 is assigned.\nArticle 325e\nComponents of the sensitivities-based method 1.

Embedded options, such as prepayment or behavioural options, shall be considered to be stand-alone positions in options for the purpose of calculating the own funds requirements for market risk.\nFor the purposes of this Chapter, instruments whose cash flows can be written as a linear function of the underlying's notional amount shall be considered to be instruments without optionality.\nArticle 325f\nOwn funds requirements for delta and vega risks 1.   Institutions shall apply the delta and vega risk factors described in Subsection 1 of Section 3 to calculate the own funds requirements for delta and vega risks. 2.   Institutions shall apply the process set out in paragraphs 3 to 8 to calculate own funds requirements for delta and vega risks. 3.   For each risk class, the sensitivity of all instruments in scope of the own funds requirements for delta or vega risks to each of the applicable delta or vega risk factors included in that risk class shall be calculated by using the corresponding formulas in Subsection 2 of Section 3. If the value of an instrument depends on several risk factors, the sensitivity shall be determined separately for each risk factor. 4.   Sensitivities shall be assigned to one of the buckets \u2018b\u2019 within each risk class. 5.   Within each bucket \u2018b\u2019, the positive and negative sensitivities to the same risk factor shall be netted, giving rise to net sensitivities (sk) to each risk factor k within a bucket. 6.   The net sensitivities to each risk factor within each bucket shall be multiplied by the corresponding risk weights set out in Section 6, giving rise to weighted sensitivities to each risk factor within that bucket in accordance with the following formula:\n \nWSk = RWk \u0387 sk\nwhere:\nWSk\n=\nthe weighted sensitivities;\nRWk\n=\nthe risk weights; and\nsk\n=\nthe risk factor. 7.   The weighted sensitivities to the different risk factors within each bucket shall be aggregated in accordance with the formula below, where the quantity within the square root function is floored at zero, giving rise to the bucket-specific sensitivity. The corresponding correlations for weighted sensitivities within the same bucket (\u03c1kl), set out in Section 6, shall be used.\n \nwhere:\nKb\n=\nthe bucket-specific sensitivity; and\nWS\n=\nthe weighted sensitivities. 8.   The bucket-specific sensitivity shall be calculated for each bucket within a risk class in accordance with paragraphs 5, 6 and 7. Once the bucket-specific sensitivity has been calculated for all buckets, weighted sensitivities to all risk factors across buckets shall be aggregated in accordance with the formula below, using the corresponding correlations \u03b3bc for weighted sensitivities in different buckets set out in Section 6, giving rise to the risk-class specific own funds requirement for delta or vega risk:\nwhere:\nSb\n=\n\u03a3k WSk for all risk factors in bucket b and Sc = \u03a3k WSk in bucket c; where those values for Sb and Sc produce a negative number for the overall sum of\n, the institution shall calculate the risk-class specific own funds requirements for delta or vega risk using an alternative specification whereby\nSb\n=\nmax [min (\u03a3k WSk, Kb), \u2013 Kb] for all risk factors in bucket b and\nSc\n=\nmax [min (\u03a3k WSk, Kc), \u2013 Kc] for all risk factors in bucket c.\nThe risk-class specific own funds requirements for delta or vega risk shall be calculated for each risk class in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 8. Article 325g\nOwn funds requirements for curvature risk\nInstitutions shall calculate the own funds requirements for curvature risk in accordance with the delegated act referred to in Article 461a.\nArticle 325h\nAggregation of risk-class specific own funds requirements for delta, vega and curvature risks 1.   Institutions shall aggregate risk-class specific own funds requirements for delta, vega and curvature risks in accordance with the process set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4. 2.   The process to calculate the risk-class specific own funds requirements for delta, vega and curvature risks described in Articles 325f and 325g shall be performed three times per risk class, each time using a different set of correlation parameters \u03c1kl (correlation between risk factors within a bucket) and \u03b3bc (correlation between buckets within a risk class). Each of those three sets shall correspond to a different scenario, as follows:\n(a) the medium correlations scenario, whereby the correlation parameters \u03c1kl and \u03b3bc remain unchanged from those specified in Section 6;\n(b) the high correlations scenario, whereby the correlation parameters \u03c1kl and \u03b3bc that are specified in Section 6 shall be uniformly multiplied by 1,25, with \u03c1kl and \u03b3bc subject to a cap at 100 %;\n(c) the low correlations scenario shall be specified in the delegated act referred to in Article 461a. 3.   Institutions shall calculate the sum of the delta, vega and curvature risk-class specific own funds requirements for each scenario to determine three scenario-specific, own funds requirements. 4.   The own funds requirement under the sensitivities-based method shall be the highest of the three scenario-specific own funds requirements referred to in paragraph 3. Article 325i\nTreatment of index instruments and multi-underlying options\nInstitutions shall treat the index instruments and multi-underlying options in accordance with the delegated act referred to in Article 461a.\nArticle 325j\nTreatment of collective investment undertakings\nInstitutions shall treat the collective investment undertakings in accordance with the delegated act referred to in Article 461a.\nArticle 325k\nUnderwriting positions 1.   Institutions may use the process set out in this Article for calculating the own funds requirements for market risk of underwriting positions of debt or equity instruments. 2.   Institutions shall apply one of the appropriate multiplying factors listed in Table 1 to the net sensitivities of all the underwriting positions in each individual issuer, excluding the underwriting positions which are subscribed or sub-underwritten by third parties on the basis of formal agreements, and calculate the own funds requirements for market risk in accordance with the approach set out in this Chapter on the basis of the adjusted net sensitivities.\nTable 1\nBusiness day 0\n0 %\nBusiness day 1\n10 %\nBusiness days 2 and 3\n25 %\nBusiness day 4\n50 %\nBusiness day 5\n75 %\nAfter business day 5\n100 %\nFor the purposes of this Article, \u2018business day 0\u2019 means the business day on which the institution becomes unconditionally committed to accepting a known quantity of securities at an agreed price. 3.   Institutions shall notify the competent authorities of the application of the process set out in this Article.\nSection 3\nRisk factor and sensitivity definitions\nSubsection 1\nRisk factor definitions\nArticle 325l\nGeneral interest rate risk factors 1.   For all general interest rate risk factors, including inflation risk and cross-currency basis risk, there shall be one bucket per currency, each containing different types of risk factor.\nThe delta general interest rate risk factors applicable to interest rate-sensitive instruments shall be the relevant risk-free rates per currency and per each of the following maturities: 0,25 years, 0,5 years, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, 30 years. Institutions shall assign risk factors to the specified vertices by linear interpolation or by using a method that is most consistent with the pricing functions used by the independent risk control function of the institution to report market risk or profits and losses to senior management. 2.   Institutions shall obtain the risk-free rates per currency from money market instruments held in the trading book of the institution that have the lowest credit risk, such as overnight index swaps. 3.   Where institutions cannot apply the approach referred to in paragraph 2, the risk-free rates shall be based on one or more market-implied swap curves used by the institution to mark positions to market, such as the interbank offered rate swap curves.\nWhere the data on market-implied swap curves described in paragraph 2 and the first subparagraph of this paragraph are insufficient, the risk-free rates may be derived from the most appropriate sovereign bond curve for a given currency.\nWhere institutions use the general interest rate risk factors derived in accordance with the procedure set out in the second subparagraph of this paragraph for sovereign debt instruments, the sovereign debt instrument shall not be exempted from the own funds requirements for credit spread risk. In those cases, where it is not possible to disentangle the risk-free rate from the credit spread component, the sensitivity to the risk factor shall be allocated both to the general interest rate risk and to credit spread risk classes. 4.   In the case of general interest rate risk factors, each currency shall constitute a separate bucket. Institutions shall assign risk factors within the same bucket, but with different maturities, a different risk weight, in accordance with Section 6. Institutions shall apply additional risk factors for inflation risk to debt instruments whose cash flows are functionally dependent on inflation rates. Those additional risk factors shall consist of one vector of market-implied inflation rates of different maturities per currency. For each instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are inflation rates used as variables by the institution's pricing model for that instrument. 5.   Institutions shall calculate the sensitivity of the instrument to the additional risk factor for inflation risk referred to in paragraph 4 as the change in the value of the instrument, according to its pricing model, as a result of a 1 basis point shift in each of the components of the vector. Each currency shall constitute a separate bucket. Within each bucket, institutions shall treat inflation as a single risk factor, regardless of the number of components of each vector. Institutions shall offset all sensitivities to inflation within a bucket, calculated as described in this paragraph, in order to give rise to a single net sensitivity per bucket. 6.   Debt instruments that involve payments in different currencies shall also be subject to cross-currency basis risk between those currencies. For the purposes of the sensitivities-based method, the risk factors to be applied by institutions shall be the cross-currency basis risk of each currency over either US dollar or euro. Institutions shall compute cross currency bases that do not relate to either basis over US dollar or basis over euro either on \u2018basis over US dollar\u2019 or \u2018basis over euro\u2019.\nEach cross-currency basis risk factor shall consist of one vector of cross-currency basis of different maturities per currency. For each debt instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are cross-currency bases used as variables by the institution's pricing model for that instrument. Each currency shall constitute a different bucket.\nInstitutions shall calculate the sensitivity of the instrument to the cross-currency basis risk factor as the change in the value of the instrument, according to its pricing model, as a result of a 1 basis point shift in each of the components of the vector. Each currency shall constitute a separate bucket. Within each bucket there shall be two possible distinct risk factors: basis over euro and basis over US dollar, regardless of the number of components there are in each cross-currency basis vector. The maximum number of net sensitivities per bucket shall be two. 7.   The vega general interest rate risk factors applicable to options with underlyings that are sensitive to general interest rate shall be the implied volatilities of the relevant risk-free rates as described in paragraphs 2 and 3, which shall be assigned to buckets depending on the currency and mapped to the following maturities within each bucket: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years. There shall be one bucket per currency.\nFor netting purposes, institutions shall consider implied volatilities linked to the same risk-free rates and mapped to the same maturities to constitute the same risk factor.\nWhere institutions map implied volatilities to the maturities as referred to in this paragraph, the following requirements shall apply:\n(a) where the maturity of the option is aligned with the maturity of the underlying, a single risk factor shall be considered, which shall be mapped to that maturity;\n(b) where the maturity of the option is shorter than the maturity of the underlying, the following risk factors shall be considered as follows:\n(i) the first risk factor shall be mapped to the maturity of the option;\n(ii) the second risk factor shall be mapped to the residual maturity of the underlying of the option at the expiry date of the option. 8.   The curvature general interest rate risk factors to be applied by institutions shall consist of one vector of risk-free rates, representing a specific risk-free yield curve, per currency. Each currency shall constitute a different bucket. For each instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are different maturities of risk-free rates used as variables by the institution's pricing model for that instrument. 9.   Institutions shall calculate the sensitivity of the instrument to each risk factor used in the curvature risk formula in accordance with Article 325g. For the purposes of the curvature risk, institutions shall consider vectors corresponding to different yield curves and with a different number of components as the same risk factor, provided that those vectors correspond to the same currency. Institutions shall offset sensitivities to the same risk factor. There shall be only one net sensitivity per bucket.\nThere shall be no curvature risk own funds requirements for inflation and cross currency basis risks.\nArticle 325m\nCredit spread risk factors for non-securitisation 1.   The delta credit spread risk factors to be applied by institutions to non-securitisation instruments that are sensitive to credit spread shall be the issuer credit spread rates of those instruments, inferred from the relevant debt instruments and credit default swaps, and mapped to each of the following maturities: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years. Institutions shall apply one risk factor per issuer and maturity, regardless of whether those issuer credit spread rates are inferred from debt instruments or credit default swaps. The buckets shall be sector buckets, as referred to in Section 6, and each bucket shall include all the risk factors allocated to the relevant sector. 2.   The vega credit spread risk factors to be applied by institutions to options with non-securitisation underlyings that are sensitive to credit spread shall be the implied volatilities of the underlying's issuer credit spread rates inferred as laid down in paragraph 1, which shall be mapped to the following maturities in accordance with the maturity of the option subject to own funds requirements: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years. The same buckets shall be used as the buckets that were used for the delta credit spread risk for non-securitisation. 3.   The curvature credit spread risk factors to be applied by institutions to non-securitisation instruments shall consist of one vector of credit spread rates, representing a credit spread curve specific to the issuer. For each instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are different maturities of credit spread rates used as variables in the institution's pricing model for that instrument. The same buckets shall be used as the buckets that were used for the delta credit spread risk for non-securitisation. 4.   Institutions shall calculate the sensitivity of the instrument to each risk factor used in the curvature risk formula in accordance with Article 325g. For the purposes of the curvature risk, institutions shall consider vectors inferred from either relevant debt instruments or credit default swaps and with a different number of components as the same risk factor, provided that those vectors correspond to the same issuer.\nArticle 325n\nCredit spread risk factors for securitisation 1.   Institutions shall apply the credit spread risk factors referred to in paragraph 3 to securitisation positions that are included in the ACTP, as referred to in Article 325(6), (7) and (8),\nInstitutions shall apply the credit spread risk factors referred to in paragraph 5 to securitisation positions that are not included in the ACTP, as referred to in Article 325(6), (7) and (8). 2.   The buckets applicable to the credit spread risk for securitisations that are included in the ACTP shall be the same as the buckets applicable to the credit spread risk for non-securitisations, as referred to in Section 6. The buckets applicable to the credit spread risk for securitisations that are not included in the ACTP shall be specific to that risk-class category, as referred to in Section 6. 3.   The credit spread risk factors to be applied by institutions to securitisation positions that are included in the ACTP are the following:\n(a) the delta risk factors shall be all the relevant credit spread rates of the issuers of the underlying exposures of the securitisation position, inferred from the relevant debt instruments and credit default swaps, and for each of the following maturities: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years.\n(b) the vega risk factors applicable to options with securitisation positions that are included in the ACTP as underlyings shall be the implied volatilities of the credit spreads of the issuers of the underlying exposures of the securitisation position, inferred as described in point (a) of this paragraph, which shall be mapped to the following maturities in accordance with the maturity of the corresponding option subject to own funds requirements: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years.\n(c) the curvature risk factors shall be the relevant credit spread yield curves of the issuers of the underlying exposures of the securitisation position expressed as a vector of credit spread rates for different maturities, inferred as indicated in point (a) of this paragraph; for each instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are different maturities of credit spread rates that are used as variables by the institution's pricing model for that instrument. 4.   Institutions shall calculate the sensitivity of the securitisation position to each risk factor used in the curvature risk formula as specified in Article 325g. For the purposes of the curvature risk, institutions shall consider vectors inferred either from relevant debt instruments or credit default swaps and with a different number of components as the same risk factor, provided that those vectors correspond to the same issuer. 5.   The credit spread risk factors to be applied by institutions to securitisation positions that are not included in the ACTP shall refer to the spread of the tranche rather than the spread of the underlying instruments and shall be the following:\n(a) the delta risk factors shall be the relevant tranche credit spread rates, mapped to the following maturities, in accordance with the maturity of the tranche: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years;\n(b) the vega risk factors applicable to options with securitisation positions that are not included in the ACTP as underlyings shall be the implied volatilities of the credit spreads of the tranches, each of them mapped to the following maturities in accordance with the maturity of the option subject to own funds requirements: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years;\n(c) the curvature risk factors shall be the same as those described in point (a) of this paragraph; to all those risk factors, a common risk weight shall be applied, as referred to in Section 6. Article 325o\nEquity risk factors 1.   The buckets for all equity risk factors shall be the sector buckets referred to in Section 6. 2.   The equity delta risk factors to be applied by institutions shall be all the equity spot prices and all equity repo rates.\nFor the purposes of equity risk, a specific equity repo curve shall constitute a single risk factor, which is expressed as a vector of repo rates for different maturities. For each instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are different maturities of repo rates that are used as variables by the institution's pricing model for that instrument.\nInstitutions shall calculate the sensitivity of an instrument to an equity risk factor as the change in the value of the instrument, according to its pricing model, as a result of a 1 basis point shift in each of the components of the vector. Institutions shall offset sensitivities to the repo rate risk factor of the same equity security, regardless of the number of components of each vector. 3.   The equity vega risk factors to be applied by institutions to options with underlyings that are sensitive to equity shall be the implied volatilities of equity spot prices which shall be mapped to the following maturities in accordance with the maturities of the corresponding options subject to own funds requirements: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years. There shall be no own funds requirements for vega risk for equity repo rates. 4.   The equity curvature risk factors to be applied by institutions to options with underlyings that are sensitive to equity are all the equity spot prices, regardless of the maturity of the corresponding options. There shall be no curvature risk own funds requirements for equity repo rates.\nArticle 325p\nCommodity risk factors 1.   The buckets for all commodity risk factors shall be the sector buckets referred to in Section 6. 2.   The commodity delta risk factors to be applied by institutions to commodity sensitive instruments shall be all the commodity spot prices per commodity type and per each of the following maturities: 0,25 years, 0,5 years, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, 30 years. Institutions shall only consider two commodity prices of the same type of commodity, and with the same maturity to constitute the same risk factor where the set of legal terms regarding the delivery location are identical. 3.   The commodity vega risk factors to be applied by institutions to options with underlyings that are sensitive to commodity shall be the implied volatilities of commodity prices per commodity type, which shall be mapped to the following maturities in accordance with the maturities of the corresponding options subject to own funds requirements: 0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years. Institutions shall consider sensitivities to the same commodity type and allocated to the same maturity to be a single risk factor which institutions shall then offset. 4.   The commodity curvature risk factors to be applied by institutions to options with underlyings that are sensitive to commodity shall be one set of commodity prices with different maturities per commodity type, expressed as a vector. For each instrument, the vector shall contain as many components as there are prices of that commodity that are used as variables by the institution's pricing model for that instrument. Institutions shall not differentiate between commodity prices by delivery location.\nThe sensitivity of the instrument to each risk factor used in the curvature risk formula shall be calculated as specified in Article 325g. For the purposes of curvature risk, institutions shall consider vectors having a different number of components to constitute the same risk factor, provided that those vectors correspond to the same commodity type.\nArticle 325q\nForeign exchange risk factors 1.   The foreign exchange delta risk factors to be applied by institutions to foreign exchange sensitive instruments shall be all the spot exchange rates between the currency in which an instrument is denominated and the institution's reporting currency. There shall be one bucket per currency pair, containing a single risk factor and a single net sensitivity. 2.   The foreign exchange vega risk factors to be applied by institutions to options with underlyings that are sensitive to foreign exchange shall be the implied volatilities of exchange rates between the currency pairs referred to in paragraph 1.

In the case of risk classes where vega risk factors have a maturity dimension, but where the rules to map the risk factors are not applicable because the options do not have a maturity, institutions shall map those risk factors to the longest prescribed maturity. Those options shall be subject to the residual risks add-on. 3.   In the case of options that do not have a strike or barrier and options that have multiple strikes or barriers, institutions shall apply the mapping to strikes and maturity used internally by the institution to price the option. Those options shall also be subject to the residual risks add-on. 4.   Institutions shall not calculate the vega risk for securitisation tranches included in the ACTP, as referred to in Article 325(6), (7) and (8), that do not have an implied volatility. Own funds requirements for delta and curvature risk shall be computed for those securitisation tranches.\nArticle 325t\nRequirements on sensitivity computations 1.   Institutions shall derive sensitivities from the institution's pricing models that serve as a basis for reporting profit and loss to senior management, using the formulas set out in this Subsection.\nBy way of derogation from the first subparagraph, competent authorities may require an institution that has been granted permission to use the alternative internal model approach set out in Chapter 1b to use the pricing functions of the risk-measurement system of their internal model approach in the calculation of sensitivities under this Chapter for the calculation and reporting of the own funds requirements for market risk in accordance with Article 430b(3). 2.   When calculating delta risk sensitivities of instruments with optionality as referred to in point (a) of Article 325e(2), institutions may assume that the implied volatility risk factors remain constant. 3.   When calculating vega risk sensitivities of instruments with optionality as referred to in point (b) of Article 325e(2), the following requirements shall apply:\n(a) for general interest rate risk and credit spread risk, institutions shall assume, for each currency, that the underlying of the volatility risk factors for which vega risk is calculated follows either a lognormal or normal distribution in the pricing models used for those instruments;\n(b) for equity risk, commodity risk and foreign exchange risk, institutions shall assume that the underlying of the volatility risk factors for which vega risk is calculated follows a lognormal distribution in the pricing models used for those instruments. 4.   Institutions shall calculate all sensitivities except for the sensitivities to credit valuation adjustments. 5.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, subject to the permission of the competent authorities, an institution may use alternative definitions of delta risk sensitivities in the calculation of the own funds requirements of a trading book position under this Chapter, provided that the institution meets all the following conditions:\n(a) those alternative definitions are used for internal risk management purposes and for the reporting of profits and losses to senior management by an independent risk control unit within the institution;\n(b) the institution demonstrates that those alternative definitions are more appropriate for capturing the sensitivities for the position than are the formulas set out in this Subsection, and that the resulting sensitivities do not materially differ from those formulas. 6.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, subject to the permission of the competent authorities, an institution may calculate vega sensitivities on the basis of a linear transformation of alternative definitions of sensitivities in the calculation of the own funds requirements of a trading book position under this Chapter, provided that the institution meets both the following conditions:\n(a) those alternative definitions are used for internal risk management purposes and for the reporting of profits and losses to senior management by an independent risk control unit within the institution;\n(b) the institution demonstrates that those alternative definitions are more appropriate for capturing the sensitivities for the position than are the formulas set out in this Subsection, and that the linear transformation referred to in the first subparagraph reflects a vega risk sensitivity.\nSection 4\nThe residual risk add-on\nArticle 325u\nOwn funds requirements for residual risks 1.   In addition to the own funds requirements for market risk set out in Section 2, institutions shall apply additional own funds requirements to instruments exposed to residual risks in accordance with this Article. 2.   Instruments are considered to be exposed to residual risks where they meet any of the following conditions:\n(a) the instrument references an exotic underlying, which, for the purposes of this Chapter, means a trading book instrument referencing an underlying exposure that is not in the scope of the delta, vega or curvature risk treatments under the sensitivities-based method laid down in Section 2 or the own funds requirements for the default risk set out in Section 5;\n(b) the instrument is an instrument bearing other residual risks, which, for the purposes of this Chapter, means any of the following instruments:\n(i) instruments that are subject to the own funds requirements for vega and curvature risk under the sensitivities-based method set out in Section 2 and that generate pay-offs that cannot be replicated as a finite linear combination of plain-vanilla options with a single underlying equity price, commodity price, exchange rate, bond price, credit default swap price or interest rate swap;\n(ii) instruments that are positions that are included in the ACTP referred to in Article 325(6); hedges that are included in that ACTP, as referred to in Article 325(8), shall not be considered. 3.   Institutions shall calculate the additional own funds requirements referred to in paragraph 1 as the sum of gross notional amounts of the instruments referred to in paragraph 2, multiplied by the following risk weights:\n(a) 1,0 % in the case of instruments referred to in point (a) of paragraph 2;\n(b) 0,1 % in the case of instruments referred to in point (b) of paragraph 2. 4.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, institution shall not apply the own funds requirement for residual risks to an instrument that meets any of the following conditions:\n(a) the instrument is listed on a recognised exchange;\n(b) the instrument is eligible for central clearing in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 648/2012;\n(c) the instrument perfectly offsets the market risk of another position in the trading book, in which case the two perfectly matching trading book positions shall be exempted from the own funds requirement for residual risks. 5.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify what an exotic underlying is and which instruments are instruments bearing residual risks for the purposes of paragraph 2. When developing those draft regulatory technical standards, EBA shall examine whether longevity risk, weather, natural disasters and future realised volatility should be considered as exotic underlyings.\nEBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 June 2021. Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.

For the purposes of this Section, the following definitions apply:\n(a) \u2018short exposure\u2019 means that the default of an issuer or group of issuers leads to a gain for the institution, regardless of the type of instrument or transaction creating the exposure;\n(b) \u2018long exposure\u2019 means that the default of an issuer or group of issuers leads to a loss for the institution, regardless of the type of instrument or transaction creating the exposure;\n(c) \u2018gross jump-to-default (gross JTD) amount\u2019 means the estimated size of the loss or gain that the default of the obligor would produce for a specific exposure;\n(d) \u2018net jump-to-default (net JTD) amount\u2019 means the estimated size of the loss or gain that an institution would incur due to the default of an obligor, after offsetting between gross JTD amounts has taken place,\n(e) \u2018loss given default\u2019 or \u2018LGD\u2019 means the loss given default of the obligor on an instrument issued by that obligor expressed as a share of the notional amount of the instrument;\n(f) \u2018default risk weight\u2019 means the percentage representing the estimated probability of the default of each obligor, according to the creditworthiness of that obligor. 2.   Own funds requirements for the default risk shall apply to debt and equity instruments, to derivative instruments having those instruments as underlyings and to derivatives, the pay-offs or fair values of which are affected by the default of an obligor other than the counterparty to the derivative instrument itself. Institutions shall calculate default risk requirements separately for each of the following types of instruments: non-securitisations, securitisations that are not included in the ACTP, and securitisations that are included in the ACTP. The final own funds requirements for the default risk to be applied by institutions shall be the sum of those three components.\nSubsection 1\nOwn funds requirements for the default risk for non-securitisations\nArticle 325w\nGross jump-to-default amounts 1.   Institutions shall calculate the gross JTD amounts for each long exposure to debt instruments as follows:\n \nJTDlong = max {LGD Vnotional + P&Llong + Adjustmentlong; 0}\nwhere:\nJTDlong\n=\nthe gross JTD amount for the long exposure;\nVnotional\n=\nthe notional amount of the instrument;\nP&Llong\n=\na term which adjusts for gains or losses already accounted for by the institution due to changes in the fair value of the instrument creating the long exposure; gains shall enter the formula with a positive sign and losses with a negative; and\nAdjustmentlong\n=\nthe amount by which, due to the structure of the derivative instrument, the institution's loss in the event of default would be increased or reduced relative to the full loss on the underlying instrument; increases shall enter the Adjustmentlong term with a positive sign and decreases with a negative sign. 2.   Institutions shall calculate the gross JTD amounts for each short exposure to debt instruments as follows:\n \nJTDshort = min {LGD Vnotional + P&Lshort + Adjustmentshort; 0}\nwhere:\nJTDshort\n=\nthe gross JTD amount for the short exposure;\nVnotional\n=\nthe notional amount of the instrument that shall enter into the formula with a negative sign;\nP&Lshort\n=\na term which adjusts for gains or losses already accounted for by the institution due to changes in the fair value of the instrument creating the short exposure; gains shall enter into the formula with a positive sign and losses shall enter into the formula with a negative sign; and\nAdjustmentshort\n=\nthe amount by which, due to the structure of the derivative instrument, the institution's gain in the event of default would be increased or reduced relative to the full loss on the underlying instrument; decreases shall enter the Adjustmentshort term with a positive sign and increases shall enter the Adjustmentshort term with a negative sign. 3.   For the purposes of the calculation set out in paragraphs 1 and 2, the LGD for debt instruments to be applied by institutions shall be the following:\n(a) exposures to non-senior debt instruments shall be assigned an LGD of 100 %;\n(b) exposures to senior debt instruments shall be assigned an LGD of 75 %;\n(c) exposures to covered bonds, as referred to in Article 129, shall be assigned an LGD of 25 %. 4.   For the purposes of the calculations set out in paragraphs 1 and 2, notional amounts shall be determined as follows:\n(a) in the case of debt instruments, the notional amount is the face value of the debt instrument;\n(b) in the case of derivative instruments with debt security underlyings, the notional amount is the notional amount of the derivative instrument. 5.   For exposures to equity instruments, institutions shall calculate the gross JTD amounts as follows, instead of using the formulas referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2:\n \nJTDlong = max {LGD \u0387 V + P&Llong + Adjustmentlong; 0}\n \nJTDshort = min {LGD \u0387 V + P&Lshort + Adjustmentshort; 0}\nwhere:\nJTDlong\n=\nthe gross JTD amount for the long exposure;\nJTDshort\n=\nthe gross JTD amount for the short exposure; and\nV\n=\nthe fair value of the equity or, in the case of derivative instruments with equity underlyings, the fair value of the equity underlying. 6.   Institutions shall assign an LGD of 100 % to equity instruments for the purposes of the calculation set out in paragraph 5. 7.   In the case of exposures to default risk arising from derivative instruments whose pay-offs in the event of default of the obligor are not related to the notional amount of a specific instrument issued by that obligor or to the LGD of the obligor or an instrument issued by that obligor, institutions shall use alternative methodologies to estimate the gross JTD amounts. 8.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:\n(a) how institutions are to calculate JTD amounts for different types of instruments in accordance with this Article;\n(b) which alternative methodologies institutions are to use for the purposes of the estimation of gross JTD amounts referred to in paragraph 7. (c) the notional amounts of instruments other than the ones referred to in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 4. EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 June 2021. Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. Article 325x\nNet jump-to-default amounts 1.   Institutions shall calculate net JTD amounts by offsetting the gross JTD amounts of short exposures and long exposures. Offsetting shall only be possible between exposures to the same obligor where the short exposures have the same seniority as, or lower seniority than, the long exposures. 2.   Offsetting shall be either full or partial, depending on the maturities of the offsetting exposures:\n(a) offsetting shall be full where all offsetting exposures have maturities of one year or more;\n(b) offsetting shall be partial where at least one of the offsetting exposures has a maturity of less than one year, in which case the size of the JTD amount of each exposure with a maturity of less than one year shall be multiplied by the ratio of the exposure's maturity relative to one year. 3.   Where no offsetting is possible gross JTD amounts shall equal net JTD amounts in the case of exposures with maturities of one year or more. Gross JTD amounts with maturities of less than one year shall be multiplied by the ratio of the exposure's maturity relative to one year, with a floor of three months, to calculate net JTD amounts. 4.   For the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 3, the maturities of the derivative contracts shall be considered, rather than those of their underlyings. Cash equity exposures shall be assigned a maturity of either one year or three months, at the institution's discretion.\nArticle 325y\nCalculation of the own funds requirements for the default risk 1.   Net JTD amounts, irrespective of the type of counterparty, shall be multiplied by the default risk weights that correspond to their credit quality, as specified in Table 2:\nTable 2\nCredit quality category\nDefault risk weight\nCredit quality step 1\n0,5 %\nCredit quality step 2\n3 %\nCredit quality step 3\n6 %\nCredit quality step 4\n15 %\nCredit quality step 5\n30 %\nCredit quality step 6\n50 %\nUnrated\n15 %\nDefaulted\n100 % 2.   Exposures which would receive a 0 % risk-weight under the Standardised Approach for credit risk in accordance with Chapter 2 of Title II shall receive a 0 % default risk weight for the own funds requirements for the default risk. 3.   The weighted net JTD shall be allocated to the following buckets: corporates, sovereigns, and local governments/municipalities. 4.   Weighted net JTD amounts shall be aggregated within each bucket, in accordance with the following formula:\n \nDRCb = max {(\u03a3i \u2208 long RWi \u0387 net JTDi) \u2013 WtS \u0387 (\u03a3i \u2208 short RWi \u0387 |net JTDi|); 0}\nwhere:\nDRCb\n=\nthe own funds requirement for the default risk for bucket b;\ni\n=\nthe index that denotes an instrument belonging to bucket b;\nRWi\n=\nthe risk weight; and\nWtS\n=\na ratio recognising a benefit for hedging relationships within a bucket, which shall be calculated as follows:\nFor the purposes of calculating the DRCb and the WtS, the long positions and short positions shall be aggregated for all positions within a bucket, regardless of the credit quality step to which those positions are allocated, to produce the bucket-specific own funds requirements for the default risk. 5.   The final own funds requirement for the default risk for non-securitisations shall be calculated as the simple sum of the bucket-level own funds requirements.\nSubsection 2\nOwn funds requirements for the default risk for securitisations not included in the ACTP\nArticle 325z\nJump-to-default amounts 1.   Gross jump-to-default amounts for securitisation exposures shall be their market value or, if their market value is not available, their fair value determined in accordance with the applicable accounting framework. 2.   Net jump-to-default amounts shall be determined by offsetting long gross jump-to-default amounts and short gross jump-to-default amounts. Offsetting shall only be possible between securitisation exposures with the same underlying asset pool and belonging to the same tranche. No offsetting shall be permitted between securitisation exposures with different underlying asset pools, even where the attachment and detachment points are the same. 3.   Where, by decomposing or combining existing securitisation exposures, other existing securitisation exposures can be perfectly replicated, except for the maturity dimension, the exposures resulting from that decomposition or combination may be used instead of the existing securitisation exposures for the purposes of offsetting. 4.   Where, by decomposing or combining existing exposures in underlying names, the entire tranche structure of an existing securitisation exposure can be perfectly replicated, the exposures resulting from that decomposition or combination may be used instead of the existing securitisation exposures for the purposes of offsetting. Where underlying names are used in that manner, they shall be removed from the non-securitisation default risk treatment. 5.   Article 325x shall apply to both existing securitisation exposures and to securitisation exposures used in accordance with paragraph 3 or 4 of this Article. The relevant maturities shall be those of the securitisation tranches.\nArticle 325aa\nCalculation of the own funds requirement for the default risk for securitisations 1.   Net JTD amounts of securitisation exposures shall be multiplied by 8 % of the risk weight that applies to the relevant securitisation exposure, including STS securitisations, in the non-trading book in accordance with the hierarchy of approaches set out in Section 3 of Chapter 5 of Title II and irrespective of the type of counterparty. 2.   A maturity of one year shall be applied to all tranches, where risk weights are calculated in accordance with the SEC-IRBA and SEC-ERBA. 3.   The risk-weighted JTD amounts for individual cash securitisation exposures shall be capped at the fair value of the position. 4.   Risk-weighted net JTD amounts shall be assigned to the following buckets:\n(a) one common bucket for all corporates, regardless of the region;\n(b) 44 different buckets corresponding to one bucket per region for each of the 11 asset classes defined in the second subparagraph.\nFor the purposes of the first subparagraph, the 11 asset classes are ABCP, auto loans/leases, residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), credit cards, commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), collateralised loan obligations, collateralised debt obligations squared (CDO-squared), small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), student loans, other retail, other wholesale. The four regions are Asia, Europe, North America, and rest of the world. 5.   In order to assign a securitisation exposure to a bucket, institutions shall rely on a classification commonly used in the market. Institutions shall assign each securitisation exposure to only one of the buckets referred to in paragraph 4. Any securitisation exposure that an institution cannot assign to a bucket for an asset class or region shall be assigned to the asset class \u2018other retail\u2019 or \u2018other wholesale\u2019 or to the region \u2018rest of the world\u2019, respectively. 6.   Weighted net JTD amounts shall be aggregated within each bucket in the same manner as for default risk of non-securitisation exposures, using the formula in Article 325y(4), resulting in the own funds requirement for the default risk for each bucket. 7.   The final own funds requirement for the default risk for securitisations not included in the ACTP shall be calculated as the simple sum of the bucket-level own funds requirements.\nSubsection 3\nOwn funds requirements for the default risk for securitisations included in the ACTP\nArticle 325ab\nScope 1.   For the ACTP, the own funds requirements shall include the default risk for securitisation exposures and for non-securitisation hedges. Those hedges shall be removed from the default risk calculations for non-securitisation. There shall be no diversification benefit between the own funds requirements for the default risk for non-securitisations, the own funds requirements for the default risk for securitisations not included in the ACTP and own funds requirements for the default risk for securitisations included in the ACTP. 2.   For traded non-securitisation credit and equity derivatives, JTD amounts by individual constituents shall be determined by applying a look-through approach.\nArticle 325ac\nJump-to-default amounts for the ACTP 1.   For the purposes of this Article, the following definitions apply:\n(a) \u2018decomposition with a valuation model\u2019 means that a single name constituent of a securitisation is valued as the difference between the unconditional value of the securitisation and the conditional value of the securitisation assuming that single name defaults with an LGD of 100 %;\n(b) \u2018replication\u2019 means that the combination of individual securitisation index tranches are combined to replicate another tranche of the same index series, or to replicate an untranched position in the index series;\n(c) \u2018decomposition\u2019 means replicating an index by a securitisation of which the underlying exposures in the pool are identical to the single name exposures that compose the index. 2.   The gross JTD amounts for securitisation exposures and non-securitisation exposures in the ACTP shall be their market value or, if their market value is not available, their fair value determined in accordance with the applicable accounting framework. 3.   Nth-to-default products shall be treated as tranched products with the following attachment and detachment points:\n(a) attachment point = (N \u2013 1) / Total Names;\n(b) detachment point = N / Total Names;\nwhere \u2018Total Names\u2019 shall be the total number of names in the underlying basket or pool. 4.   Net JTD amounts shall be determined by offsetting long gross JTD amounts and short gross JTD amounts. Offsetting shall only be possible between exposures that are otherwise identical except for maturity. Offsetting shall only be possible as follows:\n(a) for indices, index tranches and bespoke tranches, offsetting shall be possible across maturities within the same index family, series and tranche, subject to the provisions on exposures of less than one year laid down in Article 325x; long gross JTD amounts and short gross JTD amounts that perfectly replicate each other may be offset through decomposition into single name equivalent exposures using a valuation model; in such cases, the sum of the gross JTD amounts of the single name equivalent exposures obtained through decomposition shall be equal to the gross JTD amount of the undecomposed exposure;\n(b) offsetting through decomposition as set out is point (a) shall not be allowed for resecuritisations or derivatives on securitisation;\n(c) for indices and index tranches, offsetting shall be possible across maturities within the same index family, series and tranche by replication or by decomposition; where the long exposures and short exposures are otherwise equivalent, apart from one residual component, offsetting shall be allowed and the net JTD amount shall reflect the residual exposure;\n(d) different tranches of the same index series, different series of the same index and different index families may not be used to offset each other.\nArticle 325ad\nCalculation of the own funds requirements for the default risk for the ACTP 1.   Net JTD amounts shall be multiplied by:\n(a) for tranched products, the default risk weights corresponding to their credit quality as specified in Article 325y(1) and (2);\n(b) for non-tranched products, the default risk weights referred to in Article 325aa(1). 2.   Risk-weighted net JTD amounts shall be assigned to buckets that correspond to an index. 3.   Weighted net JTD amounts shall be aggregated within each bucket in accordance with the following formula:\n \nDRCb = max {(\u03a3i \u2208 long RWi \u0387 net JTDi) \u2013 WtSACTP \u0387 (\u03a3i \u2208 short RWi \u0387 |net JTDi|); 0}\nwhere:\nDRCb\n=\nthe own funds requirement for the default risk for bucket b;\ni\n=\nan instrument belonging to bucket b; and\nWtSACTP\n=\nthe ratio recognising a benefit for hedging relationships within a bucket, which shall be calculated in accordance with the WtS formula set out in Article 325y(4), but using long positions and short positions across the entire ACTP and not just the positions in the particular bucket. 4.   Institutions shall calculate the own funds requirements for the default risk for the ACTP by using the following formula:\nwhere:\nDRCACTP\n=\nthe own funds requirement for the default risk for the ACTP; and\nDRCb\n=\nthe own funds requirement for the default risk for bucket b.\nSection 6\nRisk weights and correlations\nSubsection 1\nDelta risk weights and correlations\nArticle 325ae\nRisk weights for general interest rate risk 1.   For currencies not included in the most liquid currency sub-category as referred to in point (b) of Article 325bd(7), the risk weights of the sensitivities to the risk-free rate risk factors for each bucket in Table 3 shall be specified pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 461a.\nTable 3\nBucket\nMaturity\n1\n0,25 years\n2\n0,5 years\n3\n1 year\n4\n2 years\n5\n3 years\n6\n5 years\n7\n10 years\n8\n15 years\n9\n20 years\n10\n30 years 2.   A common risk weight both for all the sensitivities to inflation and for cross currency basis risk factors shall be specified in the delegated act referred to in Article 461a. 3.   For the currencies included in the most liquid currency sub-category as referred to in point (b) of 325bd(7) and the domestic currency of the institution, the risk weights of the risk-free rate risk factors shall be the risk weights referred to in Table 3 divided by \u221a2. Article 325af\nIntra bucket correlations for general interest rate risk 1.   Between two weighted sensitivities of general interest rate risk factors WSk and WSl within the same bucket, and with the same assigned maturity but corresponding to different curves, correlation \u03c1kl shall be set at 99,90 %. 2.   Between two weighted sensitivities of general interest rate risk factors WSk and WSl within the same bucket, corresponding to the same curve, but having different maturities, correlation shall be set in accordance with the following formula:\nwhere:\nTk (respectivelyTl)\n=\nthe maturity that relates to the risk free rate;\n\u03b8\n=\n3 % 3.   Between two weighted sensitivities of general interest rate risk factors WSk and WSl within the same bucket, corresponding to different curves and having different maturities, the correlation \u03c1kl shall be equal to the correlation parameter specified in paragraph 2, multiplied by 99,90 %. 4.   Between any given weighted sensitivity of general interest rate risk factors WSk and any given weighted sensitivity of inflation risk factors WSl, the correlation shall be set at 40 %. 5.   Between any given weighted sensitivity of cross-currency basis risk factors WSk and any given weighted sensitivity of general interest rate risk factors WSl, including another cross-currency basis risk factor, the correlation shall be set at 0 %.\nArticle 325ag\nCorrelations across buckets for general interest rate risk 1.   The parameter \u03b3bc = 50 % shall be used to aggregate risk factors belonging to different buckets. 2.   The parameter \u03b3bc = 80 % shall be used to aggregate an interest rate risk factor based on a currency as referred to in Article 325av(3) and an interest rate risk factor based on the euro.\nArticle 325ah\nRisk weights for credit spread risk for non-securitisations 1.   Risk weights for the sensitivities to credit spread risk factors for non-securitisations shall be the same for all maturities (0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years) within each bucket in Table 4:\nTable 4\nBucket number\nCredit quality\nSector\nRisk weight\n(percentage points)\n1\nAll\nCentral government, including central banks, of a Member State\n0,50 %\n2\nCredit quality step 1 to 3\nCentral government, including central banks, of a third country, multilateral development banks and international organisations referred to in Article 117(2) or Article 118\n0,5 %\n3\nRegional or local authority and public sector entities\n1,0 %\n4\nFinancial sector entities including credit institutions incorporated or established by a central government, a regional government or a local authority and promotional lenders\n5,0 %\n5\nBasic materials, energy, industrials, agriculture, manufacturing, mining and quarrying\n3,0 %\n6\nConsumer goods and services, transportation and storage, administrative and support service activities\n3,0 %\n7\nTechnology, telecommunications\n2,0 %\n8\nHealth care, utilities, professional and technical activities\n1,5 %\n9\nCovered bonds issued by credit institutions in Member States\n1,0 %\n11\nCredit quality step 4 to 6\nCentral government, including central banks, of a third country, multilateral development banks and international organisations referred to in Article 117(2) or Article 118\n \n12\nRegional or local authority and public sector entities\n4,0 %\n13\nFinancial sector entities including credit institutions incorporated or established by a central government, a regional government or a local authority and promotional lenders\n12,0 %\n14\nBasic materials, energy, industrials, agriculture, manufacturing, mining and quarrying\n7,0 %\n15\nConsumer goods and services, transportation and storage, administrative and support service activities\n8,5 %\n16\nTechnology, telecommunications\n5,5 %\n17\nHealth care, utilities, professional and technical activities\n5,0 %\n18\nOther sector\n12,0 % 2.   To assign a risk exposure to a sector, institutions shall rely on a classification that is commonly used in the market for grouping issuers by sector. Institutions shall assign each issuer to only one of the sector buckets in Table 4. Risk exposures from any issuer that an institution cannot assign to a sector in such a manner shall be assigned to bucket 18 in Table 4. Article 325ai\nIntra-bucket correlations for credit spread risk for non-securitisations 1.   The correlation parameter \u03c1k\nl between two sensitivities WS\nk\n and WS\nl\n within the same bucket shall be set as follows:\n \n\u03c1kl = \u03c1kl\n(name) \u0387 \u03c1kl\n(tenor) \u0387 \u03c1kl\n(basis)\nwhere:\n \n\u03c1kl\n(name) shall be equal to 1 where the two names of sensitivities k and l are identical, otherwise it shall be equal to 35 %;\n \n\u03c1kl\n(tenor) shall be equal to 1 where the two vertices of the sensitivities k and l are identical, otherwise it shall be equal to 65 %; and\n \n\u03c1kl\n(basis) shall be equal to 1 where the two sensitivities are related to the same curves, otherwise it shall be equal to 99,90 %. 2.   The correlation parameters referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall not apply to bucket 18 in Table 4 of Article 325ah(1). The capital requirement for the delta risk aggregation formula within bucket 18 shall be equal to the sum of the absolute values of the net weighted sensitivities allocated to that bucket:\nArticle 325aj\nCorrelations across buckets for credit spread risk for non-securitisations\nThe correlation parameter \u03b3bc that applies to the aggregation of sensitivities between different buckets shall be set as follows:\n \n\u03b3bc = \u03b3bc\n(rating) \u0387 \u03b3bc\n(sector)\nwhere:\n \n\u03b3bc\n(rating) shall be equal to 1 where the two buckets have the same credit quality category (either credit quality step 1 to 3 or credit quality step 4 to 6), otherwise it shall be equal to 50 %; for the purposes of that calculation, bucket 1 shall be considered as belonging to the same credit quality category as buckets that have credit quality step 1 to 3; and\n \n\u03b3bc\n(sector) shall be equal to 1 where the two buckets belong to the same sector, and otherwise shall be equal to the corresponding percentage set out in Table 5:\nTable 5\nBucket\n1, 2 and 11\n3 and 12\n4 and 13\n5 and 14\n6 and 15\n7 and 16\n8 and 17\n9\n1, 2 and 11\n \n75 %\n10 %\n20 %\n25 %\n20 %\n15 %\n10 %\n3 and 12\n \n \n5 %\n15 %\n20 %\n15 %\n10 %\n10 %\n4 and 13\n \n \n \n5 %\n15 %\n20 %\n5 %\n20 %\n5 and 14\n \n \n \n \n20 %\n25 %\n5 %\n5 %\n6 and 15\n \n \n \n \n \n25 %\n5 %\n15 %\n7 and 16\n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 %\n20 %\n8 and 17\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 %\n9\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u2014\nArticle 325ak\nRisk weights for credit spread risk for securitisations included in the ACTP\nRisk weights for the sensitivities to credit spread risk factors for securitisations included in the ACTP risk factors shall be the same for all maturities (0,5 years, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years) within each bucket and shall be specified for each bucket in Table 6 pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 461a:\nTable 6\nBucket number\nCredit quality\nSector\n1\nAll\nCentral government, including central banks, of Member States\n2\nCredit quality step 1 to 3\nCentral government, including central banks, of a third country, multilateral development banks and international organisations referred to in Article 117(2) or Article 118\n3\nRegional or local authority and public sector entities\n4\nFinancial sector entities including credit institutions incorporated or established by a central government, a regional government or a local authority and promotional lenders\n5\nBasic materials, energy, industrials, agriculture, manufacturing, mining and quarrying\n6\nConsumer goods and services, transportation and storage, administrative and support service activities\n7\nTechnology, telecommunications\n8\nHealth care, utilities, professional and technical activities\n9\nCovered bonds issued by credit institutions in Member States\n10\nCovered bonds issued by credit institutions in third countries\n11\nCredit quality step 4 to 6\nCentral government, including central banks, of a third country, multilateral development banks and international organisations referred to in Article 117(2) or Article 118\n12\nRegional or local authority and public sector entities\n13\nFinancial sector entities including credit institutions incorporated or established by a central government, a regional government or a local authority and promotional lenders\n14\nBasic materials, energy, industrials, agriculture, manufacturing, mining and quarrying\n15\n \nConsumer goods and services, transportation and storage, administrative and support service activities\n16\nTechnology, telecommunications\n17\nHealth care, utilities, professional and technical activities\n18\nOther sector\nArticle 325al\nCorrelations for credit spread risk for securitisations included in the ACTP 1.

The risk weight of the foreign exchange risk factors concerning currency pairs which are composed of the euro and the currency of a Member State participating in the second stage of the economic and monetary union (ERM II) shall be one of the following:\n(a) the risk weight referred to in paragraph 1, divided by 3;\n(b) the maximum fluctuation within the fluctuation band formally agreed by the Member State and the European Central Bank, if that fluctuation band is narrower than the fluctuation band defined under ERM II. 3.   Notwithstanding paragraph 2, the risk weight of the foreign exchange risk factors concerning currencies referred to in paragraph 2 which participate in the ERM II with a formally agreed fluctuation band narrower than the standard band of plus or minus 15 % shall equal the maximum percentage fluctuation within that narrower band. 4.   The risk weight of the foreign exchange risk factors included in the most liquid currency pairs sub-category as referred to in point (c) of 325bd(7) shall be the risk weight referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article divided by \u221a2. 5.   Where the daily exchange-rate data for the preceding three years show that a currency pair composed of euro and a non-euro currency of a Member State is constant and that the institution is always able to face a zero bid/ask spread on the respective trades related to that currency pair, the institution may apply the risk weight referred to in paragraph 1 divided by 2, provided that it has the express permission of its competent authority to do so.\nArticle 325aw\nCorrelations for foreign exchange risk\nA uniform correlation parameter \u03b3b\nc equal to 60 % shall apply to the aggregation of sensitivities to foreign exchange risk factors.\nSubsection 2\nVega and curvature risk weights and correlations\nArticle 325ax\nVega and curvature risk weights 1.   Vega risk factors shall use the delta buckets referred to in Subsection 1. 2.   The risk weight for a given vega risk factor k shall be determined as a share of the current value of that risk factor k which represents the implied volatility of an underlying, as described in Section 3. 3.   The share referred to in paragraph 2 shall be made dependent on the presumed liquidity of each type of risk factor in accordance with the following formula:\nwhere:\n \nRWk = the risk weight for a given vega risk factor k;\n \nRW\u03c3 shall be set at 55 %; and\n \nLHrisk class is the regulatory liquidity horizon to be prescribed in the determination of each vega risk factor k. LHrisk class is determined in accordance with the following table:\nTable 11\nRisk class\nLHrisk class\nGIRR\n60\nCSR non-securitisations\n120\nCSR securitisations (ACTP)\n120\nCSR securitisations (non-ACTP)\n120\nEquity (large cap)\n20\nEquity (small cap)\n60\nCommodity\n120\nForeign exchange\n40 4.   Buckets used in the context of delta risk in Subsection 1 shall be used in the curvature risk context unless specified otherwise in this Chapter. 5.   For foreign exchange and equity curvature risk factors, the curvature risk weights shall be relative shifts equal to the delta risk weights referred to in Subsection 1. 6.   For general interest rate, credit spread and commodity curvature risk factors, the curvature risk weight shall be the parallel shift of all the vertices for each curve on the basis of the highest prescribed delta risk weight referred to in Subsection 1 for the relevant risk class.\nArticle 325ay\nVega and curvature risk correlations 1.   Between vega risk sensitivities within the same bucket of the general interest rate risk (GIRR) class, the correlation parameter rkl shall be set as follows:\nwhere:\n \n shall be equal to \n where \u03b1 shall be set at 1 %, Tk and Tl shall be equal to the maturities of the options for which the vega sensitivities are derived, expressed as a number of years; and\n \n is equal to \n, where \u03b1 is set at 1 %, \n and \n shall be equal to the maturities of the underlyings of the options for which the vega sensitivities are derived, minus the maturities of the corresponding options, expressed in both cases as a number of years. 2.   Between vega risk sensitivities within a bucket of the other risk classes, the correlation parameter \u03c1kl shall be set as follows:\nwhere:\n \n shall be equal to the delta intra-bucket correlation corresponding to the bucket to which vega risk factors k and l would be allocated; and\n \n shall be set in accordance with paragraph 1. 3.   With regard to vega risk sensitivities between buckets within a risk class (GIRR and non-GIRR), the same correlation parameters for \u03b3bc, as specified for delta correlations for each risk class in Section 4, shall be used in the vega risk context. 4.   There shall be no diversification or hedging benefit recognised in the standardised approach between vega risk factors and delta risk factors. Vega risk charges and delta risk charges shall be aggregated by simple summation. 5.   The curvature risk correlations shall be the square of corresponding delta risk correlations \u03c1kl and \u03b3bc referred to in Subsection 1. CHAPTER 1b\nAlternative internal model approach\nSection 1\nPermission and own funds requirements\nArticle 325az\nAlternative internal model approach and permission to use alternative internal models 1.   The alternative internal model approach as set out in this Chapter shall be used only for the purposes of the reporting requirement laid down in Article 430b(3). 2.   After having verified institutions' compliance with the requirements set out in Articles 325bh, 325bi and 325bj, competent authorities shall grant permission to those institutions to calculate their own funds requirements for the portfolio of all positions assigned to trading desks by using their alternative internal models in accordance with Article 325ba, provided that all the following requirements are met:\n(a) the trading desks were established in accordance with Article 104b;\n(b) the institution has provided to the competent authority a rationale for the inclusion of the trading desks in the scope of the alternative internal model approach;\n(c) the trading desks have met the back-testing requirements referred to in Article 325bf(3) for the preceding year;\n(d) the institution has reported to its competent authorities the results of the profit and loss attribution (\u2018P&L attribution\u2019) requirement for the trading desks set out in Article 325bg;\n(e) for trading desks that have been assigned at least one of those trading book positions referred to in Article 325bl, the trading desks fulfil the requirements set out in Article 325bm for the internal default risk model;\n(f) no securitisation or re-securitisation positions have been assigned to the trading desks.\nFor the purposes of point (b) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, not including a trading desk in the scope of the alternative internal model approach shall not be motivated by the fact that the own funds requirement calculated under the alternative standardised approach set out in point (a) of Article 325(3) would be lower than the own funds requirement calculated under the alternative internal model approach. 3.   Institutions that have received the permission to use the alternative internal model approach shall report to the competent authorities in accordance with Article 430b(3). 4.   An institution that has been granted the permission referred to in paragraph 2 shall immediately notify its competent authorities that one of its trading desks no longer meets at least one of the requirements set out in that paragraph. That institution shall no longer be permitted to apply this Chapter to any of the positions assigned to that trading desk and shall calculate the own funds requirements for market risk in accordance with the approach set out in Chapter 1a for all the positions assigned to that trading desk from the earliest reporting date and until the institution demonstrates to the competent authorities that the trading desk again fulfils all the requirements set out in paragraph 2. 5.   By way of derogation from paragraph 4, in extraordinary circumstances, competent authorities may permit an institution to continue using its alternative internal models for the purpose of calculating the own funds requirements for the market risk of a trading desk that no longer meets the conditions referred to in point (c) of paragraph 2 of this Article and in Article 325bg(1). When competent authorities exercise that discretion, they shall notify EBA and substantiate their decision. 6.   For positions assigned to the trading desks for which an institution has not been granted permission as referred to in paragraph 2, the own funds requirements for market risk shall be calculated by that institution in accordance with Chapter 1a of this Title. For the purposes of that calculation, all those positions shall be considered on a stand-alone basis as a separate portfolio. 7.   Material changes to the use of alternative internal models that an institution has received permission to use, the extension of the use of alternative internal models that the institution has received permission to use, and material changes to the institution's choice of the subset of the modellable risk factors referred to in Article 325bc(2), shall require separate permission from its competent authorities.\nInstitutions shall notify the competent authorities of all other extensions and changes to the use of the alternative internal models for which the institution has received permission. 8.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:\n(a) the conditions for assessing the materiality of extensions and changes to the use of alternative internal models and changes to the subset of the modellable risk factors referred to in Article 325bc;\n(b) the assessment methodology under which competent authorities verify an institution's compliance with the requirements set out in Articles 325bh, 325bi, 325bn, 325bo and 325bp.\nEBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 June 2024. Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. 9.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the extraordinary circumstances under which competent authorities may permit an institution:\n(a) to continue using its alternative internal models for the purpose of calculating the own funds requirements for the market risk of a trading desk that no longer meets the conditions referred to in point (c) of paragraph 2 of this Article and in Article 325bg(1);\n(b) to limit the add-on to the one resulting from overshootings under back-testing hypothetical changes.\nEBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 June 2024. Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. Article 325ba\nOwn funds requirements when using alternative internal models 1.   An institution using an alternative internal model shall calculate the own funds requirements for the portfolio of all positions assigned to the trading desks for which the institution has been granted permission as referred to in Article 325az(2) as the higher of the following:\n(a) the sum of the following values:\n(i) the institution's previous day's expected shortfall risk measure, calculated in accordance with Article 325bb (ESt-1), and\n(ii) the institution's previous day's stress scenario risk measure, calculated in accordance with Section 5 (SSt-1); or\n(b) the sum of the following values:\n(i) the average of the institution's daily expected shortfall risk measure, calculated in accordance with Article 325bb for each of the preceding sixty business days (ESavg), multiplied by the multiplication factor (mc); and\n(ii) the average of the institution's daily stress scenario risk measure, calculated in accordance with Section 5 for each of the preceding sixty business days (SSavg). 2.   Institutions holding positions in traded debt and equity instruments that are included in the scope of the internal default risk model and assigned to the trading desks referred to in paragraph 1 shall fulfil an additional own funds requirement, expressed as the higher of the following values:\n(a) the most recent own funds requirement for default risk, calculated in accordance with Section 3;\n(b) the average of the amount referred to in point (a) over the preceding 12 weeks.\nSection 2\nGeneral requirements\nArticle 325bb\nExpected shortfall risk measure 1.

By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, for a given trading desk, an institution may decide to replace the liquidity horizon of a broad sub-category of risk factors listed in Table 2 of this Article with one of the longer liquidity horizons listed in Table 1 of Article 325bc. Where an institution takes such a decision, the longer liquidity horizon shall apply to all the modellable risk factors of the positions assigned to that trading desk that have been mapped to that broad sub-category of risk factors for the purpose of calculating the partial expected shortfall measures in accordance with point (c) of Article 325bc(1).\nAn institution shall notify the competent authorities of the trading desks and the broad sub-categories of risk factors to which it decides to apply the treatment referred to in the first subparagraph. 4.   For the purpose of calculating the partial expected shortfall measures in accordance with point (c) of Article 325bc(1), the effective liquidity horizon of a given modellable risk factor of a given trading book position shall be calculated as follows:\nEffectiveLH =\n \nSubCatLH if Mat > LH5\nmin (SubCatLH, minj{LHj/LHj \u2265 Mat}) if LH1 \u2264 Mat \u2264 LH5\nLH1 if Mat < LH1\nwhere:\nEffectiveLH\n=\nthe effective liquidity horizon;\nMat\n=\nthe maturity of the trading book position;\nSubCatLH\n=\nthe length of liquidity horizon of the modellable risk factor determined in accordance with paragraph 1; and\nminj {LHj/LHj \u2265 Mat}\n=\nthe length of one of the liquidity horizons listed in Table 1 of Article 325bc which is the nearest liquidity horizon above the maturity of the trading book position. 5.   Currency pairs that are composed of the euro and the currency of a Member State participating in ERM II shall be included in the most liquid currency pairs sub-category within the broad category of foreign exchange risk factor of Table 2. 6.   An institution shall verify the appropriateness of the mapping referred to in paragraph 1 on at least a monthly basis. 7.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:\n(a) how institutions are to map the risk factors of the positions referred to in paragraph 1 to broad categories of risk factors and broad sub-categories of risk factors for the purposes of paragraph 1;\n(b) which currencies constitute the most liquid currencies sub-category of the broad category of interest rate risk factor of Table 2;\n(c) which currency pairs constitute the most liquid currency pairs sub-category of the broad category of foreign exchange risk factor of Table 2;\n(d) the definitions of small market capitalisation and large market capitalisation for the purposes of the equity price and volatility sub-category of the broad category of equity risk factor of Table 2. EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 March 2020. Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.

As part of the assessment referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions shall calculate the own funds requirements for market risk in accordance with Article 325bk for those risk factors that are not modellable. 3.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the criteria to assess the modellability of risk factors in accordance with paragraph 1 and to specify the frequency of that assessment.\nEBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 March 2020.

Article 325bf\nRegulatory back-testing requirements and multiplication factors 1.   For the purposes of this Article, an \u2018overshooting\u2019 means a one-day change in the value of a portfolio composed of all the positions assigned to the trading desk that exceeds the related value-at-risk number calculated on the basis of the institution's alternative internal model in accordance with the following requirements:\n(a) the calculation of the value at risk shall be subject to a one-day holding period;\n(b) scenarios of future shocks shall apply to the risk factors of the trading desk's positions referred to in Article 325bg(3) and which are considered modellable in accordance with Article 325be;\n(c) data inputs used to determine the scenarios of future shocks applied to the modellable risk factors shall be calibrated to historical data referred to in point (c) of Article 325bc(4);\n(d) unless stated otherwise in this Article, the institution's alternative internal model shall be based on the same modelling assumptions as those used for the calculation of the expected shortfall risk measure referred to in point (a) of Article 325ba(1). 2.   Institutions shall count daily overshootings on the basis of back-testing of the hypothetical and actual changes in the value of the portfolio composed of all the positions assigned to the trading desk. 3.   An institution's trading desk shall be deemed to meet the back-testing requirements where the number of overshootings for that trading desk that occurred over the most recent 250 business days does not exceed any of the following:\n(a) 12 overshootings for the value-at-risk number, calculated at a 99th percentile one tailed-confidence interval on the basis of back-testing of the hypothetical changes in the value of the portfolio;\n(b) 12 overshootings for the value-at-risk number, calculated at a 99th percentile one tailed-confidence interval on the basis of back-testing of the actual changes in the value of the portfolio;\n(c) 30 overshootings for the value-at-risk number, calculated at a 97,5th percentile one tailed-confidence interval on the basis of back-testing of the hypothetical changes in the value of the portfolio;\n(d) 30 overshootings for the value-at-risk number, calculated at a 97,5th percentile one tailed-confidence interval on the basis of back-testing of the actual changes in the value of the portfolio. 4.   Institutions shall count daily overshootings in accordance with the following:\n(a) the back-testing of hypothetical changes in the value of the portfolio shall be based on a comparison between the end-of-day value of the portfolio and, assuming unchanged positions, the value of the portfolio at the end of the subsequent day;\n(b) the back-testing of actual changes in the value of the portfolio shall be based on a comparison between the end-of-day value of the portfolio and its actual value at the end of the subsequent day, excluding fees and commissions;\n(c) an overshooting shall be counted for each business day for which the institution is not able to assess the value of the portfolio or is not able to calculate the value-at-risk number referred to in paragraph 3. 5.   An institution shall calculate, in accordance with paragraphs 6 and 7 of this Article, the multiplication factor (mc) referred to in Article 325ba for the portfolio of all the positions assigned to the trading desks for which it has been granted permission to use alternative internal models as referred to in Article 325az(2). 6.   The multiplication factor (mc) shall be the sum of the value of 1,5 and an add-on between 0 and 0,5 in accordance with Table 3. For the portfolio referred to in paragraph 5, that add-on shall be calculated on the basis of the number of overshootings that occurred over the most recent 250 business days as evidenced by the institution's back-testing of the value-at-risk number calculated in accordance with point (a) of this subparagraph. The calculation of the add-on shall be subject to the following requirements:\n(a) an overshooting shall be a one-day change in the portfolio's value that exceeds the related value-at-risk number calculated by the institution's internal model in accordance with the following:\n(i) a one-day holding period;\n(ii) a 99th percentile, one tailed confidence interval;\n(iii) scenarios of future shocks shall apply to the risk factors of the trading desks' positions referred to in Article 325bg(3) and which are considered modellable in accordance with Article 325be;\n(iv) the data inputs used to determine the scenarios of future shocks applied to the modellable risk factors shall be calibrated to historical data referred to in point (c) of Article 325bc(4);\n(v) unless stated otherwise in this Article, the institution's internal model shall be based on the same modelling assumptions as those used for the calculation of the expected shortfall risk measure referred to in point (a) of Article 325ba(1);\n(b) the number of overshootings shall be equal to the greater of the number of overshootings under hypothetical and the actual changes in the value of the portfolio.\nTable 3\nNumber of overshootings\nAdd-on\nFewer than 5\n0,00\n5\n0,20\n6\n0,26\n7\n0,33\n8\n0,38\n9\n0,42\nMore than 9\n0,50\nIn extraordinary circumstances, competent authorities may limit the add-on to that resulting from overshootings under back-testing hypothetical changes where the number of overshootings under back-testing actual changes does not result from deficiencies in the internal model. 7.   Competent authorities shall monitor the appropriateness of the multiplication factor referred to in paragraph 5 and the compliance of trading desks with the back-testing requirements referred to in paragraph 3. Institutions shall promptly notify, the competent authorities of overshootings that result from their back-testing programme and provide an explanation for those overshootings, and in any case shall notify the competent authorities thereof no later than within five business days after the occurrence of an overshooting. 8.   By way of derogation from paragraphs 2 and 6 of this Article, competent authorities may permit an institution not to count an overshooting where a one-day change in the value of its portfolio that exceeds the related value-at-risk number calculated by that institution's internal model is attributable to a non-modellable risk factor. To do so, the institution shall demonstrate to its competent authority that the stress scenario risk measure calculated in accordance with Article 325bk for that non-modellable risk factor is higher than the positive difference between the change in the value of the institution's portfolio and the related value-at-risk number. 9.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the technical elements to be included in the actual and hypothetical changes to the value of the portfolio of an institution for the purposes of this Article.\nEBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 March 2020. Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. Article 325bg\nProfit and loss attribution requirement 1.   An institution's trading desk meets the P&L attribution requirements where that trading desk complies with the requirements set out in this Article. 2.   The P&L attribution requirement shall ensure that the theoretical changes in the value of a trading desk's portfolio, based on the institution's risk-measurement model, are sufficiently close to the hypothetical changes in the value of the trading desk's portfolio, based on the institution's pricing model. 3.   For each position of a given trading desk, an institution's compliance with the P&L attribution requirement shall lead to the identification of a precise list of risk factors that are deemed appropriate for verifying the institution's compliance with the back-testing requirement set out in Article 325bf. 4.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:\n(a) the criteria necessary to ensure that the theoretical changes in the value of a trading desk's portfolio is sufficiently close to the hypothetical changes in the value of a trading desk's portfolio for the purposes of paragraph 2, taking into account international regulatory developments;\n(b) the consequences for an institution where the theoretical changes in the value of a trading desk's portfolio are not sufficiently close to the hypothetical changes in the value of a trading desk's portfolio for the purposes of paragraph 2;\n(c) the frequency at which the P&L attribution is to be performed by an institution;\n(d) the technical elements to be included in the theoretical and hypothetical changes in the value of a trading desk's portfolio for the purposes of this Article;\n(e) the manner in which institutions that use the internal model are to aggregate the total own funds requirement for market risk for all their trading book positions and non-trading book positions that are subject to foreign exchange risk or commodity risk, taking into account the consequences referred to in point (b).\nEBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 March 2020. Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. Article 325bh\nRequirements on risk measurement 1.   Institutions using an internal risk-measurement model that is used to calculate the own funds requirements for market risk as referred to in Article 325ba shall ensure that that model meets all the following requirements:\n(a) the internal risk-measurement model shall capture a sufficient number of risk factors, which shall include at least the risk factors referred to in Subsection 1 of Section 3 of Chapter 1a unless the institution demonstrates to the competent authorities that the omission of those risk factors does not have a material impact on the results of the P&L attribution requirement referred to in Article 325bg; an institution shall be able to explain to the competent authorities why it has incorporated a risk factor in its pricing model but not in its internal risk-measurement model;\n(b) the internal risk-measurement model shall capture nonlinearities for options and other products as well as correlation risk and basis risk;\n(c) the internal risk-measurement model shall incorporate a set of risk factors that correspond to the interest rates in each currency in which the institution has interest rate sensitive on- or off-balance-sheet positions; the institution shall model the yield curves using one of the generally accepted approaches; the yield curve shall be divided into various maturity segments to capture the variations of volatility of rates along the yield curve; for material exposures to interest-rate risk in the major currencies and markets, the yield curve shall be modelled using a minimum of six maturity segments, and the number of risk factors used to model the yield curve shall be proportionate to the nature and complexity of the institution's trading strategies, the model shall also capture the risk spread of less than perfectly correlated movements between different yield curves or different financial instruments on the same underlying issuer;\n(d) the internal risk-measurement model shall incorporate risk factors corresponding to gold and to the individual foreign currencies in which the institution's positions are denominated; for CIUs, the actual foreign exchange positions of the CIU shall be taken into account; institutions may rely on third-party reporting of the foreign exchange position of the CIU, provided that the correctness of that report is adequately ensured; foreign exchange positions of a CIU of which an institution is not aware of shall be carved out from the internal models approach and treated in accordance with Chapter 1a;\n(e) the sophistication of the modelling technique shall be proportionate to the materiality of the institutions' activities in the equity markets; the internal risk-measurement model shall use a separate risk factor at least for each of the equity markets in which the institution holds significant positions and at least one risk factor that captures systemic movements in equity prices and the dependency of that risk factor on the individual risk factors for each equity market;\n(f) the internal risk-measurement model shall use a separate risk factor at least for each commodity in which the institution holds significant positions, unless the institution has a small aggregate commodity position compared to all its trading activities, in which case it may use a separate risk factor for each broad commodity type; for material exposures to commodity markets, the model shall capture the risk of less than perfectly correlated movements between commodities that are similar, but not identical, the exposure to changes in forward prices arising from maturity mismatches, and the convenience yield between derivative and cash positions;\n(g) the proxies used shall show a good track record for the actual position held, shall be appropriately conservative, and shall be used only where the available data are insufficient, such as during the period of stress referred to in point (c) of Article 325bc(2);\n(h) for material exposures to volatility risks in instruments with optionality, the internal risk-measurement model shall capture the dependency of implied volatilities across strike prices and options' maturities. 2.   Institutions may use empirical correlations within broad categories of risk factors and, for the purpose of calculating the unconstrained expected shortfall measure UESt as referred to in Article 325bb(1), across broad categories of risk factors only where the institution's approach for measuring those correlations is sound, consistent with the applicable liquidity horizons, and implemented with integrity. 3.   By 28 September 2020, EBA shall issue guidelines, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, specifying criteria for the use of data inputs in the risk-measurement model referred to in Article 325bc.\nArticle 325bi\nQualitative requirements 1.   Any internal risk-measurement model used for the purposes of this Chapter shall be conceptually sound, shall be calculated and implemented with integrity, and shall comply with all the following qualitative requirements:\n(a) any internal risk-measurement model used to calculate capital requirements for market risk shall be closely integrated into the daily risk management process of the institution and shall serve as the basis for reporting risk exposures to senior management;\n(b) an institution shall have a risk control unit that is independent from business trading units and that reports directly to senior management; that unit shall be responsible for designing and implementing any internal risk-measurement model; that unit shall conduct the initial and on-going validation of any internal model used for the purposes of this Chapter and shall be responsible for the overall risk management system; that unit shall produce and analyse daily reports on the output of any internal model used to calculate capital requirements for market risk, as well as reports on the appropriateness of measures to be taken in terms of trading limits;\n(c) the management body and senior management shall be actively involved in the risk-control process, and the daily reports produced by the risk control unit shall be reviewed at a level of management with sufficient authority to require the reduction of positions taken by individual traders and to require the reduction of the institution's overall risk exposure;\n(d) the institution shall have a sufficient number of staff with a level of skills that is appropriate to the sophistication of the internal risk-measurement models, and a sufficient number of staff with skills in the trading, risk control, audit and back-office areas;\n(e) the institution shall have in place a documented set of internal policies, procedures and controls for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the overall operation of its internal risk-measurement models;\n(f) any internal risk-measurement model, including any pricing model, shall have a proven track record of being reasonably accurate in measuring risks, and shall not differ significantly from the models that the institution uses for its internal risk management;\n(g) the institution shall frequently conduct rigorous programmes of stress testing, including reverse stress tests, which shall encompass any internal risk-measurement model; the results of those stress tests shall be reviewed by senior management at least on a monthly basis and shall comply with the policies and limits approved by the management body; the institution shall take appropriate actions where the results of those stress tests show excessive losses arising from the trading's business of the institution under certain circumstances;\n(h) the institution shall conduct an independent review of its internal risk-measurement models, either as part of its regular internal auditing process, or by mandating a third-party undertaking to conduct that review, which shall be conducted to the satisfaction of the competent authorities.\nFor the purposes of point (h) of the first subparagraph, a third-party undertaking means an undertaking that provides auditing or consulting services to institutions and that has staff who have sufficient skills in the area of market risk in trading activities. 2.   The review referred to in point (h) of paragraph 1 shall include both the activities of the business trading units and the independent risk control unit. The institution shall conduct a review of its overall risk management process at least once a year. That review shall assess the following:\n(a) the adequacy of the documentation of the risk management system and process and the organisation of the risk control unit;\n(b) the integration of risk measures into daily risk management and the integrity of the management information system;\n(c) the processes the institution employs for approving the risk-pricing models and valuation systems that are used by front and back-office personnel;\n(d) the scope of risks captured by the model, the accuracy and appropriateness of the risk-measurement system, and the validation of any significant changes to the internal risk-measurement model;\n(e) the accuracy and completeness of position data, the accuracy and appropriateness of volatility and correlation assumptions, the accuracy of valuation and risk sensitivity calculations, and the accuracy and appropriateness for generating data proxies where the available data are insufficient to meet the requirement set out in this Chapter;\n(f) the verification process that the institution employs to evaluate the consistency, timeliness and reliability of the data sources used to run any of its internal risk-measurement models, including the independence of those data sources;\n(g) the verification process that the institution employs to evaluate back-testing requirements and P&L attribution requirements that are conducted in order to assess the accuracy of its internal risk-measurement models;\n(h) where the review is performed by a third-party undertaking in accordance with point (h) of paragraph 1 of this Article, the verification that the internal validation process set out in Article 325bj fulfils its objectives. 3.   Institutions shall update the techniques and practices they use for any of the internal risk-measurement models used for the purposes of this Chapter to take into account the evolution of new techniques and best practices that develop in respect of those internal risk-measurement models.\nArticle 325bj\nInternal validation 1.   Institutions shall have processes in place to ensure that any internal risk-measurement models used for the purposes of this Chapter have been adequately validated by suitably qualified parties that are independent of the development process, in order to ensure that any such models are conceptually sound and adequately capture all material risks. 2.   Institutions shall conduct the validation referred to in paragraph 1 in the following circumstances:\n(a) when any internal risk-measurement model is initially developed and when any significant changes are made to that model;\n(b) on a periodic basis, and where there have been significant structural changes in the market or changes to the composition of the portfolio which might lead to the internal risk-measurement model no longer being adequate. 3.   The validation of the internal risk-measurement models of an institution shall not be limited to back-testing and P&L attribution requirements, but shall, at a minimum, include the following:\n(a) tests to verify whether the assumptions made in the internal model are appropriate and do not underestimate or overestimate the risk;\n(b) own internal model validation tests, including back-testing in addition to the regulatory back-testing programmes, in relation to the risks and structures of their portfolios;\n(c) the use of hypothetical portfolios to ensure that the internal risk-measurement model is able to account for particular structural features that may arise, for example, material basis risks and concentration risk, or the risks associated with the use of proxies.\nArticle 325bk\nCalculation of stress scenario risk measure 1.   The \u2018stress scenario risk measure\u2019 of a given non-modellable risk factor means the loss that is incurred in all trading book positions or non-trading book positions that are subject to foreign exchange or commodity risk of the portfolio which includes that non-modellable risk factor when an extreme scenario of future shock is applied to that risk factor. 2.   Institutions shall develop appropriate extreme scenarios of future shock for all non-modellable risk factors, to the satisfaction of their competent authorities. 3.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:\n(a) how institutions are to develop extreme scenarios of future shock applicable to non-modellable risk factors and how they are to apply those extreme scenarios of future shock to those risk factors;\n(b) a regulatory extreme scenario of future shock for each broad sub-category of risk factors listed in Table 2 of Article 325bd, which institutions may use when they are unable to develop an extreme scenario of future shock in accordance with point (a) of this subparagraph, or which competent authorities may require that institution apply if those authorities are not satisfied with the extreme scenario of future shock developed by the institution;\n(c) the circumstances under which institutions may calculate a stress scenario risk measure for more than one non-modellable risk factor;\n(d) how institutions are to aggregate the stress scenario risk measures of all non-modellable risk factors included in their trading book positions and non-trading book positions that are subject to foreign exchange risk or commodity risk.\nIn developing those draft regulatory technical standards, EBA shall take into consideration the requirement that the level of own funds requirements for market risk of a non-modellable risk factor as set out in this Article shall be as high as the level of own funds requirements for market risk that would have been calculated under this Chapter if that risk factor were modellable.\nEBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 September 2020. Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. Section 3\nInternal default risk model\nArticle 325bl\nScope of the internal default risk model 1.   All the positions of an institution that have been assigned to the trading desks for which the institution has been granted permission as referred to in Article 325az(2) shall be subject to an own funds requirement for default risk where those positions contain at least one risk factor that has been mapped to the broad categories of \u2018equity\u2019 or \u2018credit spread\u2019 risk factors in accordance with Article 325bd(1). That own funds requirement, which is incremental to the risks captured by the own funds requirements referred to in Article 325ba(1), shall be calculated using the institution's internal default risk model. That model which shall comply with the requirements laid down in this Section. 2.   For each of the positions referred to in paragraph 1, an institution shall identify one issuer of traded debt or equity instruments related to at least one risk factor.\nArticle 325bm\nPermission to use an internal default risk model 1.   Competent authorities shall grant an institution permission to use an internal default risk model to calculate the own funds requirements referred to in Article 325ba(2) for all the trading book positions referred to in Article 325bl that are assigned to a trading desk for which the internal default risk model complies with the requirements set out in Articles 325bi, 325bj, 325bn, 325bo and 325bp. 2.   Where the trading desk of an institution, to which at least one of the trading book positions referred to in Article 325bl has been assigned, does not meet the requirements set out in paragraph 1 of this Article, the own funds requirements for market risk of all positions in that trading desk shall be calculated in accordance with the approach set out in Chapter 1a.\nArticle 325bn\nOwn funds requirements for default risk using an internal default risk model 1.   Institutions shall calculate the own funds requirements for default risk using an internal default risk model for the portfolio of all trading book positions as referred to in Article 325bl as follows:\n(a) the own funds requirements shall be equal to a value-at-risk number measuring potential losses in the market value of the portfolio caused by the default of issuers related to those positions at the 99,9 % confidence interval over a one-year time horizon;\n(b) the potential loss referred to in point (a) means a direct or indirect loss in the market value of a position which was caused by the default of the issuers and which is incremental to any losses already taken into account in the current valuation of the position; the default of the issuers of equity positions shall be represented by the value for the issuers' equity prices being set to zero;\n(c) institutions shall determine default correlations between different issuers on the basis of a conceptually sound methodology, using objective historical data on market credit spreads or equity prices that cover at least a 10 year period that includes the stress period identified by the institution in accordance with Article 325bc(2); the calculation of default correlations between different issuers shall be calibrated to a one-year time horizon;\n(d) the internal default risk model shall be based on a one-year constant position assumption. 2.   Institutions shall calculate the own funds requirement for default risk using an internal default risk model as referred to in paragraph 1 on at least a weekly basis. 3.   By way of derogation from points (a) and (c) of paragraph 1, an institution may replace the one-year time horizon with a time horizon of sixty days for the purpose of calculating the default risk of some or all of the equity positions, where appropriate. In such case, the calculation of default correlations between equity prices and default probabilities shall be consistent with a time horizon of sixty days and the calculation of default correlations between equity prices and bond prices shall be consistent with a one-year time horizon.\nArticle 325bo\nRecognition of hedges in an internal default risk model 1.   Institutions may incorporate hedges in their internal default risk model and may net positions where the long positions and short positions relate to the same financial instrument. 2.   In their internal default risk models, institutions may only recognise hedging or diversification effects associated with long and short positions involving different instruments or different securities of the same obligor, as well as long and short positions in different issuers by explicitly modelling the gross long and short positions in the different instruments, including modelling of basis risks between different issuers. 3.   In their internal default risk models, institutions shall capture material risks between a hedging instrument and the hedged instrument that could occur during the interval between the maturity of a hedging instrument and the one-year time horizon, as well as the potential for significant basis risks in hedging strategies that arise from differences in the type of product, seniority in the capital structure, internal or external ratings, maturity, vintage and other differences. Institutions shall recognise a hedging instrument only to the extent that it can be maintained even as the obligor approaches a credit event or other event.\nArticle 325bp\nParticular requirements for an internal default risk model 1.   The internal default risk model referred to in Article 325bm(1) shall be capable of modelling the default of individual issuers as well as the simultaneous default of multiple issuers, and shall take into account the impact of those defaults in the market values of the positions that are included in the scope of that model. For that purpose, the default of each individual issuer shall be modelled using two types of systematic risk factors. 2.   The internal default risk model shall reflect the economic cycle, including the dependency between recovery rates and the systematic risk factors referred to in paragraph 1. 3.   The internal default risk model shall reflect the nonlinear impact of options and other positions with material nonlinear behaviour with respect to price changes. Institutions shall also have due regard to the amount of model risk inherent in the valuation and estimation of price risks associated with those products. 4.   The internal default risk model shall be based on data that are objective and up-to-date. 5.   To simulate the default of issuers in the internal default risk model, the institution's estimates of default probabilities shall meet the following requirements:\n(a) the default probabilities shall be floored at 0,03 %;\n(b) the default probabilities shall be based on a one-year time horizon, unless stated otherwise in this Section;\n(c) the default probabilities shall be measured using, solely or in combination with current market prices, data observed during a historical period of at least five years of actual past defaults and extreme declines in market prices equivalent to default events; default probabilities shall not be inferred solely from current market prices;\n(d) an institution that has been granted permission to estimate default probabilities in accordance with Section 1 of Chapter 3 of Title II shall use the methodology set out therein to calculate default probabilities;\n(e) an institution that has not been granted permission to estimate default probabilities in accordance with Section 1 of Chapter 3 of Title II shall develop an internal methodology or use external sources to estimate default probabilities; in both situations, the estimates of default probabilities shall be consistent with the requirements set out in this Article. 6.   To simulate the default of issuers in the internal default risk model, the institution's estimates of loss given default shall meet the following requirements:\n(a) the loss given default estimates are floored at 0 %;\n(b) the loss given default estimates shall reflect the seniority of each position;\n(c) an institution that has been granted permission to estimate loss given default in accordance with Section 1 of Chapter 3 of Title II shall use the methodology set out therein to calculate loss given default estimates;\n(d) an institution that has not been granted permission to estimate loss given default in accordance with Section 1 of Chapter 3 of Title II shall develop an internal methodology or use external sources to estimate loss given default; in both situations, the estimates of loss given default shall be consistent with the requirements set out in this Article. 7.   As part of the independent review and validation of the internal models that they use for the purposes of this Chapter, including for the risk-measurement system, institutions shall:\n(a) verify that their approach for the modelling of correlations and price changes is appropriate for their portfolio, including the choice and weights of the systematic risk factors in the model;\n(b) perform a variety of stress tests, including sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses, to assess the qualitative and quantitative reasonableness of the internal default risk model, in particular with regard to the treatment of concentrations; and\n(c) apply appropriate quantitative validation including relevant internal modelling benchmarks.\nThe tests referred to in point (b) shall not be limited to the range of past events experienced. 8.   The internal default risk model shall appropriately reflect issuer concentrations and concentrations that can arise within and across product classes under stressed conditions. 9.   The internal default risk model shall be consistent with the institution's internal risk management methodologies for identifying, measuring, and managing trading risks. 10.   Institutions shall have clearly defined policies and procedures for determining the default assumptions for correlations between different issuers in accordance with point (c) of Article 325bn(1) and the preferred choice of method for estimating the default probabilities in point (e) of paragraph 5 of this Article and the loss given default in point (d) of paragraph 6 of this Article. 11.   Institutions shall document their internal models so that their correlation assumptions and other modelling assumptions are transparent to the competent authorities. 12.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the requirements that an institution's internal methodology or external sources are to fulfil for estimating default probabilities and losses given default in accordance with point (e) of paragraph 5 and point (d) of paragraph 6. EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 September 2020.

The total exposures to a group of connected clients shall be calculated by adding together the exposures to individual clients in that group. 2.   The overall exposures to individual clients shall be calculated by adding the exposures in the trading book and the exposures in the non-trading book. 3.   For exposures in the trading book, institutions may:\n(a) offset their long positions and short positions in the same financial instruments issued by a given client, with the net position in each of the different instruments being calculated in accordance with the methods laid down in Chapter 2 of Title IV of Part Three;\n(b) offset their long positions and short positions in different financial instruments issued by a given client, but only where the financial instrument underlying the short position is junior to the financial instrument underlying the long position or where the underlying instruments are of the same seniority.\nFor the purposes of points (a) and (b), financial instruments may be allocated into buckets on the basis of different degrees of seniority in order to determine the relative seniority of positions. 4.   Institutions shall calculate the exposure values of the derivative contracts listed in Annex II and of credit derivative contracts directly entered into with a client in accordance with one of the methods set out in Sections 3, 4 and 5 of Chapter 6 of Title II of Part Three, as applicable. Exposures resulting from the transactions referred to in Articles 378, 379 and 380 shall be calculated in the manner laid down in those Articles.\nWhen calculating the exposure value for the contracts referred to in the first subparagraph, where those contracts are allocated to the trading book, institutions shall also comply with the principles set out in Article 299. By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, institutions with permission to use the methods referred to in Section 4 of Chapter 4 of Title II of Part Three and Section 6 of Chapter 6 of Title II of Part Three may use those methods for calculating the exposure value for securities financing transactions. 5.   Institutions shall add to the total exposure to a client the exposures arising from derivative contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivative contracts, where the contract was not directly entered into with that client but the underlying debt or equity instrument was issued by that client. 6.   Exposures shall not include any of the following:\n(a) in the case of foreign exchange transactions, exposures incurred in the ordinary course of settlement during the two business days following payment;\n(b) in the case of transactions for the purchase or sale of securities, exposures incurred in the ordinary course of settlement during the five business days following payment or delivery of the securities, whichever is the earlier;\n(c) in the case of the provision of money transmission including the execution of payment services, clearing and settlement in any currency and correspondent banking or financial instruments clearing, settlement and custody services to clients, delayed receipts in funding and other exposures arising from client activity which do not last longer than the following business day;\n(d) in the case of the provision of money transmission including the execution of payment services, clearing and settlement in any currency and correspondent banking, intra-day exposures to institutions providing those services;\n(e) exposures deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 items or Additional Tier 1 items in accordance with Articles 36 and 56 or any other deduction from those items that reduces the solvency ratio. 7.   To determine the overall exposure to a client or a group of connected clients, in respect of clients to which the institution has exposures through transactions referred to in points (m) and (o) of Article 112 or through other transactions where there is an exposure to underlying assets, an institution shall assess its underlying exposures taking into account the economic substance of the structure of the transaction and the risks inherent in the structure of the transaction itself, in order to determine whether it constitutes an additional exposure. 8.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:\n(a) the conditions and methodologies to be used to determine the overall exposure to a client or a group of connected clients for the types of exposures referred to in paragraph 7;\n(b) the conditions under which the structure of the transactions referred to in paragraph 7 do not constitute an additional exposure.\nEBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2014. Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. 9.   For the purposes of paragraph 5, EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify how to determine the exposures arising from derivative contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivative contracts, where the contract was not directly entered into with a client but the underlying debt or equity instrument was issued by that client for their inclusion into the exposures to the client.\nEBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 March 2020.

Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.\u2019;\n(b) the following paragraph is inserted:\n\u20183a.   EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to specify which additional liquidity monitoring metrics as referred to in paragraph 3 shall apply to small and non-complex institutions.\nEBA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 28 June 2020. Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.\u2019;\n(110) Article 416 is amended as follows:\n(a) paragraph 3 is replaced by the following:\n\u20183.

Shares or units in CIUs may be treated as liquid assets, up to an absolute amount of EUR 500 million or the equivalent amount in domestic currency, in the portfolio of liquid assets of each institution, provided that the requirements laid down in Article 132(3) are met and that the CIU only invests in liquid assets as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, apart from derivatives to mitigate interest rate or credit or currency risk.\nThe use or potential use by a CIU of derivative instruments to hedge risks of permitted investments shall not prevent that CIU from being eligible for the treatment referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph. Where the value of the shares or units of the CIU is not regularly marked to market by the third parties referred to in points (a) and (b) of Article 418(4) and the competent authority is not satisfied that an institution has developed robust methodologies and processes for such valuation as referred to in Article 418(4), shares or units in that CIU shall not be treated as liquid assets. 6.   Where a liquid asset ceases to comply with the requirement for liquid assets as set out in this Article, an institution may nevertheless continue to consider it a liquid asset for an additional period of 30 days. Where a liquid asset in a CIU ceases to be eligible for the treatment set out in paragraph 5, the shares or units in the CIU may nevertheless be considered a liquid asset for an additional period of 30 days, provided that those assets do not exceed 10 % of the CIU's overall assets.\u2019;\n(c) paragraph 7 is deleted;\n(111) Article 419 is amended as follows:\n(a) paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:\n\u20182.   Where the justified needs for liquid assets in light of the requirement in Article 412 exceed the availability of those liquid assets in a currency, one or more of the following derogations shall apply:\n(a) by way of derogation from point (f) of Article 417, the denomination of the liquid assets may be inconsistent with the distribution by currency of liquidity outflows after the deduction of inflows;\n(b) for currencies of a Member State or third countries, required liquid assets may be substituted by credit lines from the central bank of that Member State or third country which are contractually irrevocably committed for the next 30 days and are fairly priced, independent of the amount currently drawn, provided that the competent authorities of that Member State or third country do the same and provided that that Member State or third country has comparable reporting requirements in place;\n(c) where there is a deficit of level 1 assets, additional level 2A assets may be held by the institution, subject to higher haircuts, and any cap applicable to those assets in accordance with the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1) may be amended.\u2019;\n(b) paragraph 5 is replaced by the following:\n\u20185.   EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the derogations referred to in paragraph 2, including the conditions of their application.\nEBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 28 December 2019. Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.\u2019;\n(112) Article 422 is amended as follows:\n(a) paragraph 4 is replaced by the following:\n\u20184.   Clearing, custody, cash management or other comparable services referred to in points (a) and (d) of paragraph 3 shall only cover those services to the extent that those services are rendered in the context of an established relationship on which the depositor has substantial dependence. Those services shall not merely consist of correspondent banking or prime brokerage services, and institutions shall have evidence that the client is unable to withdraw amounts legally due over a 30-day time horizon without compromising its operational functioning.\nPending a uniform definition of an established operational relationship as referred to in point (c) of paragraph 3, institutions shall themselves establish the criteria for identifying an established operational relationship for which they have evidence that the client is unable to withdraw amounts legally due over a 30-day time horizon without compromising its operational functioning and shall report those criteria to the competent authorities. In the absence of a uniform definition, competent authorities may provide general guidance that institutions are to follow in identifying deposits maintained by the depositor in a context of an established operational relationship.\u2019;\n(b) paragraph 8 is replaced by the following:\n\u20188.   Competent authorities may grant the permission to apply a lower outflow percentage to the liabilities referred to in paragraph 7 on a case-by-case basis, provided that all the following conditions are met:\n(a) the counterparty is any of the following:\n(i) a parent or subsidiary institution of the institution or another subsidiary of the same parent institution;\n(ii) the counterparty is linked to the institution by a relationship within the meaning of Article 22(7) of Directive 2013/34/EU;\n(iii) an institution falling within the same institutional protection scheme meeting the requirements of Article 113(7); or\n(iv) the central institution or a member of a network compliant with point (d) of Article 400(2);\n(b) there are reasons to expect a lower outflow over the next 30 days even under a combined idiosyncratic and market-wide stress scenario;\n(c) a corresponding symmetric or more conservative inflow is applied by the counterparty by way of derogation from Article 425;\n(d) the institution and the counterparty are established in the same Member State.\u2019;\n(113) in Article 423, paragraphs 2 and 3 are replaced by the following:\n\u20182.   An institution shall notify the competent authorities of all contracts entered into of which the contractual conditions lead to liquidity outflows or additional collateral needs, within 30 days after a material deterioration of the institution's credit quality. Where the competent authorities consider those contracts to be material in relation to the potential liquidity outflows of the institution, they shall require the institution to add an additional outflow for those contracts, which shall correspond to the additional collateral needs resulting from a material deterioration in its credit quality, such as a downgrade in its external credit assessment by three notches. The institution shall regularly review the extent of that material deterioration in light of what is relevant under the contracts it has entered into, and shall notify the result of its review to the competent authorities. 3.   The institution shall add an additional outflow which shall correspond to the collateral needs that would result from the impact of an adverse market scenario on its derivatives transactions if material.\nEBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the conditions under which the notion of materiality may be applied and specifying methods for the measurement of the additional outflow.\nEBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 March 2014. Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the second subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.\u2019;\n(114) in Article 424, paragraph 4 is replaced by the following:\n\u20184.   The committed amount of a liquidity facility that has been provided to an SSPE for the purpose of enabling that SSPE to purchase assets, other than securities, from clients that are not financial customers shall be multiplied by 10 %, provided that the committed amount exceeds the amount of assets currently purchased from clients and that the maximum amount that can be drawn is contractually limited to the amount of assets currently purchased.\u2019;\n(115) in Article 425(2), point (c) is replaced by the following:\n\u2018(c) loans with an undefined contractual end date shall be taken into account with a 20 % inflow, provided that the contract allows the institution to withdraw and request payment within 30 days;\u2019;\n(116) in Part Six, the following title is inserted after Article 428:\n                                       \u2018TITLE IV\nTHE NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO\nCHAPTER 1\nThe net stable funding ratio\nArticle 428a\nApplication on a consolidated basis\nWhere the net stable funding ratio set out in this Title applies on a consolidated basis in accordance with Article 11(4), the following provisions shall apply:\n(a) the assets and off-balance-sheet items of a subsidiary having its head office in a third country which are subject to required stable funding factors under the net stable funding requirement set out in the national law of that third country that are higher than those specified in Chapter 4 shall be subject to consolidation in accordance with the higher factors specified in the national law of that third country;\n(b) the liabilities and own funds of a subsidiary having its head office in a third country which are subject to available stable funding factors under the net stable funding requirement set out in the national law of that third country that are lower than those specified in Chapter 3 shall be subject to consolidation in accordance with the lower factors specified in the national law of that third country;\n(c) third-country assets which meet the requirements laid down in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1) and which are held by a subsidiary having its head office in a third country shall not be recognised as liquid assets for consolidation purposes where they do not qualify as liquid assets under the national law of that third country which sets out the liquidity coverage requirement;\n(d) investment firms that are not subject to this Title pursuant to Article 6(4) within the group shall be subject to Articles 413 and 428b on a consolidated basis; except as specified in this point, such investment firms shall remain subject to the detailed net stable funding requirement for investment firms as laid down in national law.\nArticle 428b\nThe net stable funding ratio 1.   The net stable funding requirement laid down in Article 413(1) shall be equal to the ratio of the institution's available stable funding as referred to in Chapter 3 to the institution's required stable funding as referred to in Chapter 4, and shall be expressed as a percentage. Institutions shall calculate their net stable funding ratio in accordance with the following formula: 2.   Institutions shall maintain a net stable funding ratio of at least 100 %, calculated in the reporting currency for all their transactions, irrespective of their actual currency denomination. 3.   Where, at any time, the net stable funding ratio of an institution has fallen below 100 %, or can be reasonably expected to fall below 100 %, the requirement laid down in Article 414 shall apply. The institution shall aim to restore its net stable funding ratio to the level referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article. Competent authorities shall assess the reasons for the institution's failure to comply with paragraph 2 of this Article before taking any supervisory measures. 4.   Institutions shall calculate and monitor their net stable funding ratio in the reporting currency for all their transactions, irrespective of their actual currency denomination, and separately for their transactions denominated in each of the currencies that is subject to separate reporting in accordance with Article 415(2). 5.   Institutions shall ensure that the distribution of their funding profile by currency denomination is generally consistent with the distribution of their assets by currency. Where appropriate, competent authorities may require institutions to restrict currency mismatches by setting limits on the proportion of required stable funding in a particular currency that can be met by available stable funding that is not denominated in that currency. That restriction may only be applied for a currency that is subject to separate reporting in accordance with Article 415(2).\nIn determining the level of any restriction on currency mismatches that may be applied in accordance with this Article, competent authorities shall at least consider:\n(a) whether the institution has the ability to transfer available stable funding from one currency to another and across jurisdictions and legal entities within its group and the ability to swap currencies and raise funds in foreign currency markets over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio;\n(b) the impact of adverse exchange rate movements on existing mismatched positions and on the effectiveness of any foreign currency exchange hedges that are in place.\nAny restriction on currency mismatches imposed in accordance with this Article shall constitute a specific liquidity requirement as referred to in Article 105 of Directive 2013/36/EU.\nCHAPTER 2\nGeneral rules for the calculation of the net stable funding ratio\nArticle 428c\nCalculation of the net stable funding ratio 1.   Unless otherwise specified in this Title, institutions shall take into account assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet items on a gross basis. 2.   For the purpose of calculating their net stable funding ratio, institutions shall apply the appropriate stable funding factors set out in Chapters 3 and 4 to the accounting value of their assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet items, unless otherwise specified in this Title. 3.   Institutions shall not double count required stable funding and available stable funding.\nUnless otherwise specified in this Title, where an item can be allocated to more than one required stable funding category, it shall be allocated to the required stable funding category that produces the greatest contractual required stable funding for that item.\nArticle 428d\nDerivative contracts 1.   Institutions shall apply this Article to calculate the amount of required stable funding for derivative contracts as referred to in Chapters 3 and 4. 2.   Without prejudice to Article 428ah(2), institutions shall take into account the fair value of derivative positions on a net basis where those positions are included in the same netting set that fulfils the requirements set out in Article 429c(1). Where that is not the case, institutions shall take into account the fair value of derivative positions on a gross basis and shall treat those derivative positions as belonging to their own netting set for the purposes of Chapter 4. 3.   For the purposes of this Title, the \u2018fair value of a netting set\u2019 means the sum of the fair values of all the transactions included in a netting set. 4.   Without prejudice to Article 428ah(2), all derivative contracts listed in points 2(a) to (e) of Annex II that involve a full exchange of principal amounts on the same date shall be calculated on a net basis across currencies, including for the purpose of reporting in a currency that is subject to separate reporting in accordance with Article 415(2), even where those transactions are not included in the same netting set that fulfils the requirements set out in Article 429c(1). 5.   Cash received as collateral to mitigate the exposure of a derivative position shall be treated as such and shall not be treated as deposits to which Chapter 3 applies. 6.   Competent authorities may decide, with the approval of the relevant central bank, to waive the impact of derivative contracts on the calculation of the net stable funding ratio, including through the determination of the required stable funding factors and of provisions and losses, provided that all the following conditions are met:\n(a) those contracts have a residual maturity of less than six months;\n(b) the counterparty is the ECB or the central bank of a Member State;\n(c) the derivative contracts serve the monetary policy of the ECB or the central bank of a Member State.\nWhere a subsidiary having its head office in a third country benefits from the waiver referred to in the first subparagraph under the national law of that third country which sets out the net stable funding requirement, that waiver as specified in the national law of the third country shall be taken into account for consolidation purposes.\nArticle 428e\nNetting of secured lending transactions and capital market-driven transactions\nAssets and liabilities resulting from securities financing transactions with a single counterparty shall be calculated on a net basis, provided that those assets and liabilities comply with the netting conditions set out in Article 429b(4).\nArticle 428f\nInterdependent assets and liabilities 1.   Subject to prior approval of the competent authorities, an institution may treat an asset and a liability as interdependent, provided that all the following conditions are met:\n(a) the institution acts solely as a pass-through unit to channel the funding from the liability into the corresponding interdependent asset;\n(b) the individual interdependent assets and liabilities are clearly identifiable and have the same principal amount;\n(c) the asset and interdependent liability have substantially matched maturities, with a maximum delay of 20 days between the maturity of the asset and the maturity of the liability;\n(d) the interdependent liability has been requested pursuant to a legal, regulatory or contractual commitment and is not used to fund other assets;\n(e) the principal payment flows from the asset are not used for other purposes than repaying the interdependent liability;\n(f) the counterparties for each pair of interdependent assets and liabilities are not the same. 2.   Assets and liabilities shall be considered to meet the conditions set out in paragraph 1 and be considered as interdependent where they are directly linked to the following products or services:\n(a) centralised regulated savings, provided that institutions are legally required to transfer regulated deposits to a centralised fund which is set up and controlled by the central government of a Member State and which provides loans to promote public interest objectives, and provided that the transfer of deposits to the centralised fund occurs on at least a monthly basis;\n(b) promotional loans and credit and liquidity facilities that fulfil the criteria set out in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1) for institutions acting as simple intermediaries that do not incur any funding risk;\n(c) covered bonds that meet all the following conditions:\n(i) they are bonds referred to in Article 52(4) of Directive 2009/65/EC or they meet the eligibility requirements for the treatment set out in Article 129(4) or (5) of this Regulation;\n(ii) the underlying loans are fully match funded with the covered bonds that were issued or the covered bonds have non-discretionary extendable maturity triggers of one year or more until the term of the underlying loans in the event of refinancing failure at the maturity date of the covered bond;\n(d) derivative client clearing activities, provided that the institution does not provide to its clients guarantees of the performance of the CCP and, as a result, does not incur any funding risk. 3.   EBA shall monitor assets and liabilities, as well as products and services that are treated as interdependent assets and liabilities under paragraphs 1 and 2, to determine whether and to what extent the suitability criteria laid down in paragraph 1 are met. EBA shall report to the Commission on the results of that monitoring and shall advise the Commission on whether an amendment to the conditions set out in paragraph 1 or an amendment to the list of products and services in paragraph 2 would be necessary.\nArticle 428g\nDeposits in institutional protection schemes and cooperative networks\nWhere an institution belongs to an institutional protection scheme of the type referred to in Article 113(7), to a network that is eligible for the waiver provided for in Article 10, or to a cooperative network in a Member State, the sight deposits that the institution maintains with the central institution and that the depositing institution considers to be liquid assets pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1) shall be subject to the following:\n(a) the depositing institution shall apply the required stable funding factor under Section 2 of Chapter 4, depending on the treatment of those sight deposits as level 1, level 2A or level 2B assets pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1) and depending on the relevant haircut applied to those sight deposits for the calculation of the liquidity coverage ratio;\n(b) the central institution receiving the deposit shall apply the corresponding symmetric available stable funding factor.\nArticle 428h\nPreferential treatment within a group or within an institutional protection scheme 1.   By way of derogation from Chapters 3 and 4, where Article 428g does not apply, competent authorities may authorise institutions on a case-by-case basis to apply a higher available stable funding factor or a lower required stable funding factor to assets, liabilities and committed credit or liquidity facilities, provided that all the following conditions are met:\n(a) the counterparty is one of the following:\n(i) the parent or a subsidiary of the institution;\n(ii) another subsidiary of the same parent;\n(iii) an undertaking that is related to the institution within the meaning of Article 22(7) of Directive 2013/34/EU;\n(iv) a member of the same institutional protection scheme referred to in Article 113(7) of this Regulation as the institution;\n(v) the central body or an affiliated credit institution of a network or a cooperative group as referred to in Article 10 of this Regulation;\n(b) there are reasons to expect that the liability or committed credit or liquidity facility received by the institution constitutes a more stable source of funding, or that the asset or committed credit or liquidity facility granted by the institution requires less stable funding over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio than the same liability, asset or committed credit or liquidity facility received or granted by other counterparties;\n(c) the counterparty applies a required stable funding factor that is equal to or higher than the higher available stable funding factor or applies an available stable funding factor that is equal to or lower than the lower required stable funding factor;\n(d) the institution and the counterparty are established in the same Member State. 2.   Where the institution and the counterparty are established in different Member States, competent authorities may waive the condition set out in point (d) of paragraph 1, provided that, in addition to the criteria set out in paragraph 1, the following criteria are met:\n(a) there are legally binding agreements and commitments between group entities regarding the liability, asset or committed credit or liquidity facility;\n(b) the funding provider presents a low funding risk profile;\n(c) the funding risk profile of the recipient of the funding has been adequately taken into account in the liquidity risk management of the funding provider.\nThe competent authorities shall consult each other in accordance with point (b) of Article 20(1) to determine whether the additional criteria set out in this paragraph are met.\nCHAPTER 3\nAvailable stable funding\nSection 1\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 428i\nCalculation of the amount of available stable funding\nUnless otherwise specified in this Chapter, the amount of available stable funding shall be calculated by multiplying the accounting value of various categories or types of liabilities and own funds by the available stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2. The total amount of available stable funding shall be the sum of the weighted amounts of liabilities and own funds.\nBonds and other debt securities that are issued by the institution, sold exclusively in the retail market, and held in a retail account, may be treated as belonging to the appropriate retail deposit category. Limitations shall be in place, such that those instruments cannot be bought and held by parties other than retail customers.\nArticle 428j\nResidual maturity of a liability or of own funds 1.   Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, institutions shall take into account the residual contractual maturity of their liabilities and own funds to determine the available stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2. 2.   Institutions shall take into account existing options in determining the residual maturity of a liability or of own funds. They shall do so on the assumption that the counterparty will redeem call options at the earliest possible date. For options exercisable at the discretion of the institution, the institution and the competent authorities shall take into account reputational factors that may limit an institution's ability not to exercise the option, in particular market expectations that institutions should redeem certain liabilities before their maturity. 3.   Institutions shall treat deposits with fixed notice periods in accordance with their notice period, and shall treat term deposits in accordance with their residual maturity. By way of derogation from paragraph 2 of this Article, institutions shall not take into account options for early withdrawals where the depositor has to pay a material penalty for early withdrawals which occur in less than one year, such penalty being laid down in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), to determine the residual maturity of term retail deposits. 4.   In order to determine the available stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2, institutions shall treat any portion of liabilities having a residual maturity of one year or more that matures in less than six months and any portion of such liabilities that matures between six months and less than one year as having a residual maturity of less than six months and between six months and less than one year, respectively.\nSection 2\nAvailable stable funding factors\nArticle 428k\n0 % available stable funding factor 1.   Unless otherwise specified in Articles 428l to 428o, all liabilities without a stated maturity, including short positions and open maturity positions, shall be subject to a 0 % available stable funding factor, with the exception of the following:\n(a) deferred tax liabilities, which shall be treated in accordance with the nearest possible date on which such liabilities could be realised;\n(b) minority interests, which shall be treated in accordance with the term of the instrument. 2.   Deferred tax liabilities and minority interests as referred to in paragraph 1 shall be subject to one of the following factors:\n(a) 0 %, where the effective residual maturity of the deferred tax liability or minority interest is less than six months;\n(b) 50 %, where the effective residual maturity of the deferred tax liability or minority interest is a minimum of six months but less than one year;\n(c) 100 %, where the effective residual maturity of the deferred tax liability or minority interest is one year or more. 3.   The following liabilities shall be subject to a 0 % available stable funding factor:\n(a) trade date payables arising from purchases of financial instruments, of foreign currencies and of commodities, that are expected to settle within the standard settlement cycle or period that is customary for the relevant exchange or type of transactions, or that have failed to settle but are nonetheless expected to settle;\n(b) liabilities that are categorised as being interdependent with assets in accordance with Article 428f;\n(c) liabilities with a residual maturity of less than six months provided by:\n(i) the ECB or the central bank of a Member State;\n(ii) the central bank of a third country;\n(iii) financial customers;\n(d) any other liabilities and capital items or instruments not referred to in Articles 428l to 428o. 4.   Institutions shall apply a 0 % available stable funding factor to the absolute value of the difference, if negative, between the sum of fair values across all netting sets with positive fair value and the sum of fair values across all netting sets with negative fair value calculated in accordance with Article 428d.\nThe following rules shall apply to the calculation referred to in the first subparagraph:\n(a) variation margin received by institutions from their counterparties shall be deducted from the fair value of a netting set with positive fair value where the collateral received as variation margin qualifies as a level 1 asset pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), excluding extremely high quality covered bonds specified in that delegated act, and where institutions are legally entitled and operationally able to reuse that collateral;\n(b) all variation margin posted by institutions with their counterparties shall be deducted from the fair value of a netting set with negative fair value.\nArticle 428l\n50 % available stable funding factor\nThe following liabilities shall be subject to a 50 % available stable funding factor:\n(a) deposits received that fulfil the criteria for operational deposits set out in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1);\n(b) liabilities with a residual maturity of less than one year provided by:\n(i) the central government of a Member State or of a third country;\n(ii) regional governments or local authorities of a Member State or of a third country;\n(iii) public sector entities in a Member State or in a third country;\n(iv) multilateral development banks referred to in Article 117(2) and international organisations referred to in Article 118;\n(v) non-financial corporate customers;\n(vi) credit unions authorised by a competent authority, personal investment companies and clients that are deposit brokers to the extent that those liabilities do not fall under point (a) of this paragraph;\n(c) liabilities with a residual contractual maturity of a minimum of six months but less than one year that are provided by:\n(i) the ECB or the central bank of a Member State;\n(ii) the central bank of a third country;\n(iii) financial customers;\n(d) any other liabilities with a residual maturity of a minimum of six months but less than one year not referred to in Articles 428m, 428n and 428o.\nArticle 428m\n90 % available stable funding factor\nSight retail deposits, retail deposits with a fixed notice period of less than one year and term retail deposits having a residual maturity of less than one year that fulfil the relevant criteria for other retail deposits set out in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1) shall be subject to a 90 % available stable funding factor.\nArticle 428n\n95 % available stable funding factor\nSight retail deposits, retail deposits with a fixed notice period of less than one year and term retail deposits having a residual maturity of less than one year that fulfil the relevant criteria for stable retail deposits set out in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1) shall be subject to a 95 % available stable funding factor.\nArticle 428o\n100 % available stable funding factor\nThe following liabilities and capital items and instruments shall be subject to a 100 % available stable funding factor:\n(a) the Common Equity Tier 1 items of the institution before the adjustments required pursuant to Articles 32 to 35, the deductions pursuant to Article 36 and the application of the exemptions and alternatives laid down in Articles 48, 49 and 79;\n(b) the Additional Tier 1 items of the institution before the deduction of the items referred to in Article 56 and before Article 79 has been applied thereto, excluding any instruments with explicit or embedded options that, if exercised, would reduce the effective residual maturity to less than one year;\n(c) the Tier 2 items of the institution before the deductions referred to in Article 66 and before the application of Article 79, having a residual maturity of one year or more, excluding any instruments with explicit or embedded options that, if exercised, would reduce the effective residual maturity to less than one year;\n(d) any other capital instruments of the institution with a residual maturity of one year or more, excluding any instruments with explicit or embedded options that, if exercised, would reduce the effective residual maturity to less than one year;\n(e) any other secured and unsecured borrowings and liabilities with a residual maturity of one year or more, including term deposits, unless otherwise specified in Articles 428k to 428n.\nCHAPTER 4\nRequired stable funding\nSection 1\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 428p\nCalculation of the amount of required stable funding 1.   Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, the amount of required stable funding shall be calculated by multiplying the accounting value of various categories or types of assets and off-balance-sheet items by the required stable funding factors to be applied in accordance with Section 2. The total amount of required stable funding shall be the sum of the weighted amounts of assets and off-balance-sheet items. 2.   Assets which institutions have borrowed, including in securities financing transactions, shall be excluded from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding where those assets are accounted for on the balance sheet of the institution and the institution does not have beneficial ownership of the asset.\nAssets that institutions have borrowed, including in securities financing transactions, shall be subject to the required stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2 where those assets are not accounted for on the balance sheet of the institution but the institution does have beneficial ownership of the assets. 3.   Assets that institutions have lent, including in securities financing transactions over which the institution retains beneficial ownership, shall be considered as encumbered assets for the purposes of this Chapter and shall be subject to the required stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2, even where the assets do not remain on the balance sheet of the institution. Otherwise, such assets shall be excluded from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding. 4.   Assets that are encumbered for a residual maturity of six months or longer shall be assigned either the required stable funding factor that would be applied under Section 2 to those assets if they were held unencumbered or the required stable funding factor that is otherwise applicable to those encumbered assets, whichever factor is higher. The same shall apply where the residual maturity of the encumbered assets is shorter than the residual maturity of the transaction that is the source of encumbrance.\nAssets that have less than six months remaining in the encumbrance period shall be subject to the required stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2 to the same assets if they were held unencumbered. 5.   Where an institution reuses or repledges an asset that was borrowed, including in securities financing transactions, and that asset is accounted for off-balance-sheet, the transaction in relation to which that asset has been borrowed shall be treated as encumbered, provided that the transaction cannot mature without the institution returning the asset borrowed. 6.   The following assets shall be considered to be unencumbered:\n(a) assets included in a pool which are available for immediate use as collateral to obtain additional funding under committed or, where the pool is operated by a central bank, uncommitted but not yet funded, credit lines that are available to the institution; those assets shall include assets placed by a credit institution with a central institution in a cooperative network or institutional protection scheme; institutions shall assume that assets in the pool are encumbered in order of increasing liquidity on the basis of the liquidity classification pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), starting with assets ineligible for the liquidity buffer;\n(b) assets that the institution has received as collateral for credit risk mitigation purposes in secured lending, secured funding or collateral exchange transactions and that the institution may dispose of;\n(c) assets attached as non-mandatory overcollateralisation to a covered bond issuance. 7.   In the case of non-standard, temporary operations conducted by the ECB or the central bank of a Member State or the central bank of a third country in order to fulfil its mandate in a period of market-wide financial stress or in exceptional macroeconomic circumstances, the following assets may receive a reduced required stable funding factor:\n(a) by way of derogation from point (f) of Article 428ad and from point (a) of Article 428ah(1), assets encumbered for the purposes of the operations referred to in this subparagraph;\n(b) by way of derogation from points (d)(i) and (d)(ii) of Article 428ad, from point (b) of Article 428af and from point (c) of Article 428ag, monies that result from the operations referred to in this subparagraph.\nCompetent authorities shall determine, in agreement with the central bank that is the counterparty to the transaction the required stable funding factor to be applied to the assets referred to in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph. For encumbered assets as referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph, the required stable funding factor to be applied shall not be lower than the required stable funding factor that would apply under Section 2 to those assets if they were held unencumbered.\nWhen applying a reduced required stable funding factor in accordance with the second subparagraph, competent authorities shall closely monitor the impact of that reduced factor on institutions' stable funding positions and shall take appropriate supervisory measures where necessary. 8.   In order to avoid any double counting, institutions shall exclude assets that are associated with collateral that is recognised as variation margin posted in accordance with point (b) of Article 428k(4) and 428ah(2), recognised as initial margin posted, or recognised as a contribution to the default fund of a CCP in accordance with points (a) and (b) of Article 428ag from other parts of calculation of the amount of required stable funding in accordance with this Chapter. 9.   Institutions shall include foreign currencies and commodities for which a purchase order has been executed in the calculation of the amount of required stable funding financial instruments. They shall exclude financial instruments, foreign currencies and commodities for which a sale order has been executed from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding, provided that those transactions are not reflected as derivatives or secured funding transactions on the institutions' balance sheet and that those transactions are to be reflected on the institutions' balance sheet when settled. 10.   Competent authorities may determine the required stable funding factors to be applied to off-balance-sheet exposures that are not referred to in this Chapter to ensure that institutions hold an appropriate amount of available stable funding for the portion of those exposures that are expected to require funding over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio. To determine those factors, competent authorities shall, in particular, take into account the material reputational damage to the institution that could result from not providing that funding.\nCompetent authorities shall report the types of off-balance-sheet exposures for which they have determined the required stable funding factors to EBA at least once a year. They shall include an explanation of the methodology applied to determine those factors in that report.\nArticle 428q\nResidual maturity of an asset 1.   Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, institutions shall take into account the residual contractual maturity of their assets and off-balance-sheet transactions when determining the required stable funding factors to be applied to their assets and off-balance-sheet items under Section 2. 2.   Institutions shall treat assets that have been segregated in accordance with Article 11(3) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 in accordance with the underlying exposure of those assets. Institutions shall, however, subject those assets to higher required stable funding factors, depending on the term of encumbrance to be determined by the competent authorities, who shall consider whether the institution is able to freely dispose of or exchange such assets and shall consider the term of the liabilities to the institutions' customers to whom that segregation requirement relates. 3.   When calculating the residual maturity of an asset, institutions shall take options into account, based on the assumption that the issuer or counterparty will exercise any option to extend the maturity of an asset. For options that are exercisable at the discretion of the institution, the institution and competent authorities shall take into account reputational factors that may limit the institution's ability not to exercise the option, in particular markets' and clients' expectations that the institution should extend the maturity of certain assets at their maturity date. 4.   In order to determine the required stable funding factors to be applied in accordance with Section 2, for amortising loans with a residual contractual maturity of one year or more, any portion that matures in less than six months and any portion that matures between six months and less than one year shall be treated as having a residual maturity of less than six months and between six months and less than one year, respectively.\nSection 2\nRequired stable funding factors\nArticle 428r\n0 % required stable funding factor 1.   The following assets shall be subject to a 0 % required stable funding factor:\n(a) unencumbered assets that are eligible as level 1 high quality liquid assets pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), excluding extremely high quality covered bonds specified in that delegated act, regardless of whether they comply with the operational requirements as set out in that delegated act;\n(b) unencumbered shares or units in CIUs that are eligible for a 0 % haircut for the calculation of the liquidity coverage ratio pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), regardless of whether they comply with the operational requirements and with the requirements on the composition of the liquidity buffer set out in that delegated act;\n(c) all reserves held by the institution in the ECB or in the central bank of a Member State or the central bank of a third country, including required reserves and excess reserves;\n(d) all claims on the ECB, the central bank of a Member State or the central bank of a third country that have a residual maturity of less than six months;\n(e) trade date receivables arising from sales of financial instruments, foreign currencies or commodities that are expected to settle within the standard settlement cycle or period that is customary for the relevant exchange or type of transaction, or that have failed to settle but are nonetheless expected to settle;\n(f) assets that are categorised as being interdependent with liabilities in accordance with Article 428f;\n(g) monies due from securities financing transactions with financial customers, where those transactions have a residual maturity of less than six months, where those monies due are collateralised by assets that qualify as level 1 assets pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), excluding extremely high quality covered bonds specified therein, and where the institution would be legally entitled and operationally able to reuse those assets for the duration of the transaction.\nInstitutions shall take the monies due referred to in point (g) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph into account on a net basis where Article 428e applies. 2.   By way of derogation from point (c) of paragraph 1, competent authorities may decide, with the agreement of the relevant central bank, to apply a higher required stable funding factor to required reserves, taking into account, in particular, the extent to which reserve requirements exist over a one-year horizon and therefore require associated stable funding.\nFor subsidiaries having their head office in a third country, where the required central bank reserves are subject to a higher required stable funding factor under the net stable funding requirement set out in the national law of that third country, that higher required stable funding factor shall be taken into account for consolidation purposes.\nArticle 428s\n5 % required stable funding factor 1.   The following assets and off-balance-sheet items shall be subject to a 5 % required stable funding factor:\n(a) unencumbered shares or units in CIUs that are eligible for a 5 % haircut for the calculation of the liquidity coverage ratio in accordance with the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), regardless of whether they comply with the operational requirements and with the requirements on the composition of the liquidity buffer as set out in that delegated act;\n(b) monies due from securities financing transactions with financial customers, where those transactions have a residual maturity of less than six months, other than those referred to in point (g) of Article 428r(1);\n(c) the undrawn portion of committed credit and liquidity facilities pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1);\n(d) trade finance off-balance-sheet related products as referred to in Annex I with a residual maturity of less than six months.\nInstitutions shall take the monies due referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph into account on a net basis where Article 428e applies. 2.   For all netting sets of derivative contracts, institutions shall apply a 5 % required stable funding factor to the absolute fair value of those netting sets of derivative contracts, gross of any collateral posted, where those netting sets have a negative fair value. For the purposes of this paragraph, institutions shall determine the fair value as gross of any collateral posted or settlement payments and receipts related to market valuation changes of such contracts.\nArticle 428t\n7 % required stable funding factor\nUnencumbered assets that are eligible as level 1 extremely high quality covered bonds pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1) shall be subject to a 7 % required stable funding factor, regardless of whether they comply with the operational requirements and with the requirements on the composition of the liquidity buffer as set out in that delegated act.\nArticle 428u\n7,5 % required stable funding factor\nTrade finance off-balance-sheet related products as referred to in Annex I with a residual maturity of at least six months but less than one year shall be subject to a 7,5 % required stable funding factor.\nArticle 428v\n10 % required stable funding factor\nThe following assets and off-balance-sheet items shall be subject to a 10 % required stable funding factor:\n(a) monies due from transactions with financial customers that have a residual maturity of less than six months other than those referred to in point (g) of Article 428r(1) and in point (b) of Article 428s(1);\n(b) trade finance on-balance-sheet related products with a residual maturity of less than six months;\n(c) trade finance off-balance-sheet related products as referred to in Annex I with a residual maturity of one year or more.\nArticle 428w\n12 % required stable funding factor\nUnencumbered shares or units in CIUs that are eligible for a 12 % haircut for the calculation of the liquidity coverage ratio in accordance with the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1) shall be subject to a 12 % required stable

be applied to the unencumbered asset shall apply;\n(c) unencumbered loans with a residual maturity of one year or more, excluding loans to financial customers and loans referred to in Articles 428r to 428af, which are not past due for more than 90 days and which are assigned a risk weight of more than 35 % in accordance with Chapter 2 of Title II of Part Three;\n(d) trade finance on-balance-sheet related products, with a residual maturity of one year or more;\n(e) unencumbered securities with a residual maturity of one year or more that are not in default in accordance with Article 178 and that are not eligible as liquid assets pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1);\n(f) unencumbered exchange-traded equities that are not eligible as level 2B assets pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1);\n(g) physically traded commodities, including gold but excluding commodity derivatives;\n(h) assets encumbered for a residual maturity of one year or more in a cover pool funded by covered bonds as referred to in Article 52(4) of Directive 2009/65/EC or covered bonds which meet the eligibility requirements for the treatment as set out in Article 129(4) or (5) of this Regulation.\nArticle 428ah\n100 % required stable funding factor 1.   The following assets shall be subject to a 100 % required stable funding factor:\n(a) unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, any assets encumbered for a residual maturity of one year or more;\n(b) any assets other than those referred to in Articles 428r to 428ag, including loans to financial customers having a residual contractual maturity of one year or more, non-performing exposures, items deducted from own funds, fixed assets, non-exchange-traded equities, retained interest, insurance assets, defaulted securities. 2.   Institutions shall apply a 100 % required stable funding factor to the difference, if positive, between the sum of fair values across all netting sets with positive fair value and the sum of fair values across all netting sets with negative fair value calculated in accordance with Article 428d.\nThe following rules shall apply to the calculation referred to in the first subparagraph:\n(a) variation margin received by institutions from their counterparties shall be deducted from the fair value of a netting set with positive fair value where the collateral received as variation margin qualifies as a level 1 asset pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), excluding extremely high quality covered bonds specified in that delegated act, and where institutions are legally entitled and operationally able to reuse that collateral;\n(b) all variation margin posted by institutions with their counterparties shall be deducted from the fair value of a netting set with negative fair value.\nCHAPTER 5\nDerogation for small and non-complex institutions\nArticle 428ai\nDerogation for small and non-complex institutions\nBy way of derogation from Chapters 3 and 4, small and non-complex institutions may choose, with the prior permission of their competent authority, to calculate the ratio between an institution's available stable funding as referred to in Chapter 6, and the institution's required stable funding as referred to in Chapter 7, expressed as a percentage.\nA competent authority may require a small and non-complex institution to comply with the net stable funding requirement based on an institution's available stable funding as referred to in Chapter 3 and the required stable funding as referred to in Chapter 4 where it considers that the simplified methodology is not adequate to capture the funding risks of that institution.\nCHAPTER 6\nAvailable stable funding for the simplified calculation of the net stable funding ratio\nSection 1\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 428aj\nSimplified calculation of the amount of available stable funding 1.   Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, the amount of available stable funding shall be calculated by multiplying the accounting value of various categories or types of liabilities and own funds by the available stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2. The total amount of available stable funding shall be the sum of the weighted amounts of liabilities and own funds. 2.   Bonds and other debt securities that are issued by the institution, sold exclusively in the retail market, and held in a retail account, may be treated as belonging to the appropriate retail deposit category. Limitations shall be in place, such that those instruments cannot be bought and held by parties other than retail customers.\nArticle 428ak\nResidual maturity of a liability or own funds 1.   Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, institutions shall take into account the residual contractual maturity of their liabilities and own funds to determine the available stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2. 2.   Institutions shall take into account existing options in determining the residual maturity of a liability or of own funds. They shall do so on the assumption that the counterparty will redeem call options at the earliest possible date. For options exercisable at the discretion of the institution, the institution and the competent authorities shall take into account reputational factors that may limit an institution's ability not to exercise the option, in particular market expectations that institutions should redeem certain liabilities before their maturity. 3.   Institutions shall treat deposits with fixed notice periods in accordance with their notice period, and shall treat term deposits in accordance with their residual maturity. By way of derogation from paragraph 2 of this Article, institutions shall not take into account options for early withdrawals where the depositor has to pay a material penalty for early withdrawals which occur in less than one year, such penalty being laid down in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), to determine the residual maturity of term retail deposits. 4.   In order to determine the available stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2, for liabilities with a residual contractual maturity of one year or more, any portion that matures in less than six months and any portion that matures between six months and less than one year, shall be treated as having a residual maturity of less than six months and between six months and less than one year, respectively.\nSection 2\nAvailable stable funding factors\nArticle 428al\n0 % available stable funding factor 1.   Unless otherwise specified in this Section, all liabilities without a stated maturity, including short positions and open maturity positions, shall be subject to a 0 % available stable funding factor, with the exception of the following:\n(a) deferred tax liabilities, which shall be treated in accordance with the nearest possible date on which such liabilities could be realised;\n(b) minority interests, which shall be treated in accordance with the term of the instrument concerned. 2.   Deferred tax liabilities and minority interests as referred to in paragraph 1 shall be subject to one of the following factors:\n(a) 0 %, where the effective residual maturity of the deferred tax liability or minority interest is less than one year;\n(b) 100 %, where the effective residual maturity of the deferred tax liability or minority interest is one year or more. 3.   The following liabilities shall be subject to a 0 % available stable funding factor:\n(a) trade date payables arising from purchases of financial instruments, of foreign currencies and of commodities, that are expected to settle within the standard settlement cycle or period that is customary for the relevant exchange or type of transaction, or that have failed to settle but are nonetheless expected to settle;\n(b) liabilities that are categorised as being interdependent with assets in accordance with Article 428f;\n(c) liabilities with a residual maturity of less than one year provided by:\n(i) the ECB or the central bank of a Member State;\n(ii) the central bank of a third country;\n(iii) financial customers;\n(d) any other liabilities and capital items or instruments not referred to in this Article and Articles 428am to 428ap. 4.   Institutions shall apply a 0 % available stable funding factor to the absolute value of the difference, if negative, between the sum of fair values across all netting sets with positive fair value and the sum of fair values across all netting sets with negative fair value calculated in accordance with Article 428d.\nThe following rules shall apply to the calculation referred to in the first subparagraph:\n(a) variation margin received by institutions from their counterparties shall be deducted from the fair value of a netting set with positive fair value where the collateral received as variation margin qualifies as a level 1 asset pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), excluding extremely high quality covered bonds specified in that delegated act, and where institutions are legally entitled and operationally able to reuse that collateral;\n(b) all variation margin posted by institutions with their counterparties shall be deducted from the fair value of a netting set with negative fair value.\nArticle 428am\n50 % available stable funding factor\nThe following liabilities shall be subject to a 50 % available stable funding factor:\n(a) deposits received that fulfil the criteria for operational deposits set out in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1);\n(b) liabilities with a residual maturity of less than one year provided by:\n(i) the central government of a Member State or of a third country;\n(ii) regional governments or local authorities in a Member State or in a third country;\n(iii) public sector entities of a Member State or of a third country;\n(iv) multilateral development banks referred to in Article 117(2) and international organisations referred to in Article 118;\n(v) non-financial corporate customers;\n(vi) credit unions authorised by a competent authority, personal investment companies and clients that are deposit brokers, with the exception of deposits received, that fulfil the criteria for operational deposits as set out in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1).\nArticle 428an\n90 % available stable funding factor\nSight retail deposits, retail deposits with a fixed notice period of less than one year and term retail deposits having a residual maturity of less than one year that fulfil the relevant criteria for other retail deposits set out in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1) shall be subject to a 90 % available stable funding factor.\nArticle 428ao\n95 % available stable funding factor\nSight retail deposits, retail deposits with a fixed notice period of less than one year and term retail deposits having a residual maturity of less than one year that fulfil the relevant criteria for stable retail deposits set out in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1) shall be subject to a 95 % available stable funding factor.\nArticle 428ap\n100 % available stable funding factor\nThe following liabilities and capital items and instruments shall be subject to a 100 % available stable funding factor:\n(a) the Common Equity Tier 1 items of the institution before the adjustments required pursuant to Articles 32 to 35, the deductions pursuant to Article 36 and the application of the exemptions and alternatives laid down in Articles 48, 49 and 79;\n(b) the Additional Tier 1 items of the institution before the deduction of the items referred to in Article 56 and before Article 79 has been applied thereto, excluding any instruments with explicit or embedded options that, if exercised, would reduce the effective residual maturity to less than one year;\n(c) the Tier 2 items of the institution before the deductions referred to in Article 66 and before the application of Article 79, having a residual maturity of one year or more, excluding any instruments with explicit or embedded options that, if exercised, would reduce the effective residual maturity to less than one year;\n(d) any other capital instruments of the institution with a residual maturity of one year or more, excluding any instruments with explicit or embedded options that, if exercised, would reduce the effective residual maturity to less than one year;\n(e) any other secured and unsecured borrowings and liabilities with a residual maturity of one year or more, including term deposits, unless otherwise specified in Articles 428al to 428ao.\nCHAPTER 7\nRequired stable funding for the simplified calculation of the net stable funding ratio\nSection 1\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 428aq\nSimplified calculation of the amount of required stable funding 1.   Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, for small and non-complex institutions the amount of required stable funding shall be calculated by multiplying the accounting value of various categories or types of assets and off-balance-sheet items by the required stable funding factors to be applied in accordance with Section 2. The total amount of required stable funding shall be the sum of the weighted amounts of assets and off-balance-sheet items. 2.   Assets that institutions have borrowed, including in securities financing transactions, that are accounted for in their balance sheet and on which they do not have beneficial ownership shall be excluded from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding.\nAssets that institutions have borrowed, including in securities financing transactions, that are not accounted for in their balance sheet but on which they have beneficial ownership shall be subject to the required stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2. 3.   Assets that institutions have lent, including in securities financing transactions, over which they retain beneficial ownership, even where they do not remain on their balance sheet, shall be considered as encumbered assets for the purposes of this Chapter and shall be subject to required stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2. Otherwise, such assets shall be excluded from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding. 4.   Assets that are encumbered for a residual maturity of six months or longer shall be assigned either the required stable funding factor that would be applied under Section 2 to those assets if they were held unencumbered or the required stable funding factor that is otherwise applicable to those encumbered assets, whichever factor is higher. The same shall apply where the residual maturity of the encumbered assets is shorter than the residual maturity of the transaction that is the source of encumbrance.\nAssets that have less than six months remaining in the encumbrance period shall be subject to the required stable funding factors to be applied under Section 2 to the same assets if they were held unencumbered. 5.   Where an institution reuses or repledges an asset that was borrowed, including in securities financing transactions, and that is accounted for off-balance-sheet, the transaction through which that asset has been borrowed shall be treated as encumbered to the extent that the transaction cannot mature without the institution returning the asset borrowed. 6.   The following assets shall be considered to be unencumbered:\n(a) assets included in a pool which are available for immediate use as collateral to obtain additional funding under committed or, where the pool is operated by a central bank, uncommitted but not yet funded credit lines available to the institution, including assets placed by a credit institution with the central institution in a cooperative network or institutional protection scheme;\n(b) assets that the institution has received as collateral for credit risk mitigation purposes in secured lending, secured funding or collateral exchange transactions and that the institution may dispose of;\n(c) assets attached as non-mandatory over-collateralisation to a covered bond issuance.\nFor the purposes of point (a) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, institutions shall assume that assets in the pool are encumbered in order of increasing liquidity on the basis of the liquidity classification set out in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), starting with assets ineligible for the liquidity buffer. 7.   In the case of non-standard, temporary operations conducted by the ECB or the central bank of a Member State or the central bank of a third country in order to fulfil its mandate in a period of market-wide financial stress or exceptional macroeconomic circumstances, the following assets may receive a reduced required stable funding factor:\n(a) by way of derogation from Article 428aw and from point (a) of Article 428az(1), assets encumbered for the operations referred to in this subparagraph;\n(b) by way of derogation from Article 428aw and from point (b) of Article 428ay, monies resulting from the operations referred to in this subparagraph.\nCompetent authorities shall determine, in agreement with the central bank that is the counterparty to the transaction the required stable funding factor to be applied to the assets referred to in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph. For encumbered assets referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph, the required stable funding factor to be applied shall not be lower than the required stable funding factor that would apply under Section 2 to those assets if they were held unencumbered.\nWhen applying a reduced required stable funding factor in accordance with the second subparagraph, competent authorities shall closely monitor the impact of that reduced factor on institutions' stable funding positions and take appropriate supervisory measures where necessary. 8.   Institutions shall exclude assets associated with collateral recognised as variation margin posted in accordance with point (b) of Article 428k(4) and Article 428ah(2) or as initial margin posted or as contribution to the default fund of a CCP in accordance with points (a) and (b) of Article 428ag from other parts of calculation of the amount of required stable funding in accordance with this Chapter in order to avoid any double counting. 9.   Institutions shall include in the calculation of the amount of required stable funding financial instruments, foreign currencies and commodities for which a purchase order has been executed. They shall exclude from the calculation of the amount of required stable funding financial instruments, foreign currencies and commodities for which a sale order has been executed, provided that those transactions are not reflected as derivatives or secured funding transactions on the institutions' balance sheet and that those transactions are to be reflected on the institutions' balance sheet when settled. 10.   Competent authorities may determine the required stable funding factors to be applied to off-balance-sheet exposures that are not referred to in this Chapter to ensure that institutions hold an appropriate amount of available stable funding for the portion of those exposures that are expected to require funding over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio. To determine those factors, competent authorities shall, in particular, take into account the material reputational damage to the institution that could result from not providing that funding.\nCompetent authorities shall report to EBA the types of off-balance-sheet exposures for which they have determined the required stable funding factors at least once a year. They shall include in that report an explanation of the methodology applied to determine those factors.\nArticle 428ar\nResidual maturity of an asset 1.   Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, institutions shall take into account the residual contractual maturity of their assets and off-balance-sheet transactions when determining the required stable funding factors to be applied to their assets and off-balance-sheet items under Section 2. 2.   Institutions shall treat assets that have been segregated in accordance with Article 11(3) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 in accordance with the underlying exposure of those assets. Institutions shall, however, subject those assets to higher required stable funding factors, depending on the term of encumbrance to be determined by the competent authorities, who shall consider whether the institution is able to freely dispose of or exchange such assets and shall consider the term of the liabilities to the institutions' customers to whom that segregation requirement relates. 3.   When calculating the residual maturity of an asset, institutions shall take options into account, based on the assumption that the issuer or counterparty will exercise any option to extend the maturity of an asset. For options that are exercisable at the discretion of the institution, the institution and competent authorities shall take into account reputational factors that may limit the institution's ability not to exercise the option, in particular markets' and clients' expectations that the institution should extend the maturity of certain assets at their maturity date. 4.   In order to determine the required stable funding factors to be applied in accordance with Section 2, for amortising loans with a residual contractual maturity of one year or more, the portions that mature in less than six months and between six months and less than one year shall be treated as having a residual maturity of less than six months and between six months and less than one year respectively.\nSection 2\nRequired stable funding factors\nArticle 428as\n0 % required stable funding factor 1.   The following assets shall be subject to a 0 % required stable funding factor:\n(a) unencumbered assets that are eligible as level 1 high quality liquid assets pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), excluding extremely high quality covered bonds specified in that delegated act, regardless of whether they comply with the operational requirements as set out in that delegated act;\n(b) all reserves held by the institution in the ECB or in the central bank of a Member State or the central bank of a third country, including required reserves and excess reserves;\n(c) all claims on the ECB, the central bank of a Member State or the central bank of a third country that have a residual maturity of less than six months;\n(d) assets that are categorised as being interdependent with liabilities in accordance with Article 428f. 2.   By way of derogation from point (b) of paragraph 1, competent authorities may decide, with the agreement of the relevant central bank, to apply a higher required stable funding factor to required reserves, taking into account, in particular, the extent to which reserve requirements exist over a one-year horizon and therefore require associated stable funding.\nFor subsidiaries having their head office in a third country, where the required central bank reserves are subject to a higher required stable funding factor under the net stable funding requirement set out in the national law of that third country, that higher required stable funding factor shall be taken into account for consolidation purposes.\nArticle 428at\n5 % required stable funding factor 1.   The undrawn portion of committed credit and liquidity facilities specified in the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1) shall be subject to a 5 % required stable funding factor. 2.   For all netting sets of derivative contracts, institutions shall apply a 5 % required stable funding factor to the absolute fair value of those netting sets of derivative contracts, gross of any collateral posted, where those netting sets have a negative fair value. For the purposes of this paragraph, institutions shall determine the fair value as gross of any collateral posted or settlement payments and receipts related to market valuation changes of such contracts.\nArticle 428au\n10 % required stable funding factor\nThe following assets and off-balance-sheet items shall be subject to a 10 % required stable funding factor:\n(a) unencumbered assets that are eligible as level 1 extremely high quality covered bonds pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), regardless of whether they comply with the operational requirements and with the requirements on the composition of the liquidity buffer as set out in that delegated act;\n(b) trade finance off-balance-sheet related products as referred to in Annex I.\nArticle 428av\n20 % required stable funding factor\nUnencumbered assets that are eligible as level 2A assets pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), and unencumbered shares or units in CIUs pursuant to that delegated act shall be subject to a 20 % required stable funding factor, regardless of whether they comply with the operational requirements and with the requirements on the composition of the liquidity buffer as set out in that delegated act.\nArticle 428aw\n50 % required stable funding factor\nThe following assets shall be subject to a 50 % required stable funding factor:\n(a) secured and unsecured loans with a residual maturity of less than one year and provided that they are encumbered less than one year;\n(b) any other assets with a residual maturity of less than one year, unless otherwise specified in Articles 428as to 428av;\n(c) assets encumbered for a residual maturity of at least six months but less than one year, except where those assets would be assigned a higher required stable funding factor in accordance with Articles 428ax, 428ay and 428az if they were held unencumbered, in which case the higher required stable funding factor that would apply to those assets if they were held unencumbered shall apply.\nArticle 428ax\n55 % required stable funding factor\nAssets that are eligible as level 2B assets pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), and shares or units in CIUs pursuant to that delegated act shall be subject to a 55 % required stable funding factor, regardless of whether they comply with the operational requirements and with the requirements on the composition of the liquidity buffer as set out in that delegated act, provided that they are encumbered less than one year.\nArticle 428ay\n85 % required stable funding factor\nThe following assets and off-balance-sheet items shall be subject to a 85 % required stable funding factor:\n(a) any assets and off-balance-sheet items, including cash, posted as initial margin for derivative contracts or posted as contribution to the default fund of a CCP, unless those assets would be assigned a higher required stable funding factor in accordance with Article 428az if held unencumbered, in which case the higher required stable funding factor that would apply to those assets if they were held unencumbered shall apply;\n(b) unencumbered loans with a residual maturity of one year or more, excluding loans to financial customers, which are not past due for more than 90 days;\n(c) trade finance on-balance-sheet related products, with a residual maturity of one year or more;\n(d) unencumbered securities with a residual maturity of one year or more that are not in default in accordance with Article 178 and that are not eligible as liquid assets pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1);\n(e) unencumbered exchange-traded equities that are not eligible as level 2B assets pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1);\n(f) physically traded commodities, including gold but excluding commodity derivatives.\nArticle 428az\n100 % required stable funding factor 1.   The following assets shall be subject to a 100 % required stable funding factor:\n(a) any assets encumbered for a residual maturity of one year or more;\n(b) any assets other than those referred to in Articles 428as to 428ay, including loans to financial customers having a residual contractual maturity of one year or more, non-performing exposures, items deducted from own funds, fixed assets, non-exchange traded equities, retained interest, insurance assets, defaulted securities. 2.   Institutions shall apply a 100 % required stable funding factor to the difference, if positive, between the sum of fair values across all netting sets with positive fair value and the sum of fair values across all netting sets with negative fair value calculated in accordance with Article 428d.\nThe following rules shall apply to the calculation referred to in the first subparagraph:\n(a) variation margin received by institutions from their counterparties shall be deducted from the fair value of a netting set with positive fair value where the collateral received as variation margin qualifies as a level 1 asset pursuant to the delegated act referred to in Article 460(1), excluding extremely high quality covered bonds specified in that delegated act, and where institutions are legally entitled and operationally able to reuse that collateral;\n(b) all variation margin posted by institutions with their counterparties shall be deducted from the fair value of a netting set with negative fair value.\u2019;\n(117) Part Seven is replaced by the following:\n                                       \u2018PART SEVEN\nLEVERAGE\nArticle 429\nCalculation of the leverage ratio 1.   Institutions shall calculate their leverage ratio in accordance with the methodology set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4. 2.   The leverage ratio shall be calculated as an institution's capital measure divided by that institution's total exposure measure and shall be expressed as a percentage.\nInstitutions shall calculate the leverage ratio at the reporting reference date. 3.   For the purposes of paragraph 2, the capital measure shall be the Tier 1 capital. 4.   For the purposes of paragraph 2, the total exposure measure shall be the sum of the exposure values of:\n(a) assets, excluding derivative contracts listed in Annex II, credit derivatives and the positions referred to in Article 429e, calculated in accordance with Article 429b(1);\n(b) derivative contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivatives, including those contracts and credit derivatives that are off-balance-sheet, calculated in accordance with Articles 429c and 429d;\n(c) add-ons for counterparty credit risk of securities financing transactions, including those that are off-balance-sheet, calculated in accordance with Article 429e;\n(d) off-balance-sheet items, excluding derivative contracts listed in Annex II, credit derivatives, securities financing transactions and positions referred to in Articles 429d and 429g, calculated in accordance with Article 429f;\n(e) regular-way purchases or sales awaiting settlement, calculated in accordance with Article 429g.\nInstitutions shall treat long settlement transactions in accordance with points (a) to (d) of the first subparagraph, as applicable.\nInstitutions may reduce the exposure values referred to in points (a) and (d) of the first subparagraph by the corresponding amount of general credit risk adjustments to on- and off-balance-sheet items, respectively, subject to a floor of 0 where the credit risk adjustments have reduced the Tier 1 capital. 5.   By way of derogation from point (d) of paragraph 4, the following provisions shall apply:\n(a) a derivative instrument that is considered an off-balance-sheet item in accordance with point (d) of paragraph 4 but is treated as a derivative in accordance with the applicable accounting framework, shall be subject to the treatment set out in that point;\n(b) where a client of an institution acting as a clearing member enters directly into a derivative transaction with a CCP and the institution guarantees the performance of its client's trade exposures to the CCP arising from that transaction, the institution shall calculate its exposure resulting from the guarantee in accordance with point (b) of paragraph 4, as if that institution had entered directly into the transaction with the client, including with regard to the receipt or provision of cash variation margin.\nThe treatment set out in point (b) of the first subparagraph shall also apply to an institution acting as a higher-level client that guarantees the performance of its client's trade exposures.\nFor the purposes of point (b) of the first subparagraph and of the second subparagraph of this paragraph, institutions may consider an affiliated entity as a client only where that entity is outside the regulatory scope of consolidation at the level at which the requirement set out in point (d) of Article 92(3) is applied. 6.   For the purposes of point (e) of paragraph 4 of this Article and Article 429g, \u2018regular-way purchase or sale\u2019 means a purchase or a sale of a security under contracts for which the terms require delivery of the security within the period established generally by law or convention in the marketplace concerned. 7.   Unless otherwise expressly provided for in this Part, institutions shall calculate the total exposure measure in accordance with the following principles:\n(a) physical or financial collateral, guarantees or credit risk mitigation purchased shall not be used to reduce the total exposure measure;\n(b) assets shall not be netted with liabilities. 8.   By way of derogation from point (b) of paragraph 7, institutions may reduce the exposure value of a pre-financing loan or an intermediate loan by the positive balance on the savings account of the debtor to which the loan was granted and only include the resulting amount in the total exposure measure, provided that all the following conditions are met:\n(a) the granting of the loan is conditional upon the opening of the savings account at the institution granting the loan and both the loan and the savings account are regulated by the same sectoral law;\n(b) the balance on the savings account cannot be withdrawn, in part or in full, by the debtor for the entire duration of the loan;\n(c) the institution can unconditionally and irrevocably use the balance on the savings account to settle any claim originating under the loan agreement in cases regulated by the sectoral law referred to in point (a), including the case of non-payment by or the insolvency of the debtor.\n\u2018Pre-financing loan\u2019 or \u2018intermediate loan\u2019 means a loan that is granted to the borrower for a limited period of time in order to bridge the borrower's financing gaps until the final loan is granted in accordance with the criteria laid down in the sectoral law regulating such transactions.\nArticle 429a\nExposures excluded from the total exposure measure 1.   By way of derogation from Article 429(4), an institution may exclude any of the following exposures from its total exposure measure:\n(a) the amounts deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 items in accordance with point (d) of Article 36(1);\n(b) the assets deducted in the calculation of the capital measure referred to in Article 429(3);\n(c) exposures that are assigned a risk weight of 0 % in accordance with Article 113(6) or (7);\n(d) where the institution is a public development credit institution, the exposures arising from assets that constitute claims on central governments, regional governments, local authorities or public sector entities in relation to public sector investments and promotional loans;\n(e) where the institution is not a public development credit institution, the parts of exposures arising from passing-through promotional loans to other credit institutions;\n(f) the guaranteed parts of exposures arising from export credits that meet both of the following conditions:\n(i) the guarantee is provided by an eligible provider of unfunded credit protection in accordance with Articles 201 and 202, including by export credit agencies or by central governments;\n(ii) a 0 % risk weight applies to the guaranteed part of the exposure in accordance with Article 114(2) or (4) or Article 116(4);\n(g) where the institution is a clearing member of a QCCP, the trade exposures of that institution, provided that they are cleared with that QCCP and meet the conditions set out in point (c) of Article 306(1);\n(h) where the institution is a higher-level client within a multi-level client structure, the trade exposures to the clearing member or to an entity that serves as a higher-level client to that institution, provided that the conditions set out in Article 305(2) are met and provided that the institution is not obligated to reimburse its client for any losses suffered in the event of default of either the clearing member or the QCCP;\n(i) fiduciary assets which meet all the following conditions:\n(i) they are recognised on the institution's balance sheet by national generally accepted accounting principles, in accordance with Article 10 of Directive 86/635/EEC;\n(ii) they meet the criteria for non-recognition set out in International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 9, as applied in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002;\n(iii) they meet the criteria for non-consolidation set out in IFRS 10, as applied in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002, where applicable;\n(j) exposures that meet all the following conditions:\n(i) they are exposures to a public sector entity;\n(ii) they are treated in accordance with Article 116(4);\n(iii) they arise from deposits that the institution is legally obliged to transfer to the public sector entity referred to in point (i) for the purpose of funding general interest investments;\n(k) the excess collateral deposited at tri-party agents that has not been lent out;\n(l) where under the applicable accounting framework an institution recognises the variation margin paid in cash to its counterparty as a receivable asset, the receivable asset, provided that the conditions set out in points (a) to (e) of Article 429c(3) are met;\n(m) the securitised exposures from traditional securitisations that meet the conditions for significant risk transfer set out in Article 244(2);\n(n) the following exposures to the institution's central bank entered into after the exemption took effect and subject to the conditions set out in paragraphs 5 and 6:\n(i) coins and banknotes constituting legal currency in the jurisdiction of the central bank;\n(ii) assets representing claims on the central bank, including reserves held at the central bank;\n(o) where the institution is authorised in accordance with Article 16 and point (a) of Article 54(2) of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014, the institution's exposures due to banking-type ancillary services listed in point (a) of Section C of the Annex to that Regulation which are directly related to the core or ancillary services listed in Sections A and B of that Annex;\n(p) where the institution is designated in accordance with point (b) of Article 54(2) of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014, the institution's exposures due to banking-type ancillary services listed in point (a) of Section C of the Annex to that Regulation which are directly related to the core or ancillary services of a central securities depository, authorised in accordance with Article 16 of that Regulation, listed in Sections A and B of that Annex.\nFor the purposes of point (m) of the first subparagraph, institutions shall include any retained exposure in the total exposure measure. 2.   For the purposes of points (d) and (e) of paragraph 1, \u2018public development credit institution\u2019 means a credit institution that meets all the following conditions:\n(a) it has been established by a Member State's central government, regional government or local authority;\n(b) its activity is limited to advancing specified objectives of financial, social or economic public policy in accordance with the laws and provisions governing that institution, including articles of association, on a non-competitive basis;\n(c) its goal is not to maximise profit or market share;\n(d) subject to Union State aid rules, the central government, regional government or local authority has an obligation to protect the credit institution's viability or directly or indirectly guarantees at least 90 % of the credit institution's own funds requirements, funding requirements or promotional loans granted;\n(e) it does not take covered deposits as defined in point (5) of Article 2(1) of Directive 2014/49/EU or in national law implementing that Directive that may be classified as fixed term or savings deposits from consumers as defined in point (a) of Article 3 of Directive 2008/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (*13).\nFor the purposes of point (b) of the first subparagraph, public policy objectives may include the provision of financing for promotional or development purposes to specified economic sectors or geographical areas of the relevant Member State.\nFor the purposes of points (d) and (e) of the first subparagraph, and without prejudice to the Union State aid rules and the obligations of the Member States thereunder, competent authorities may, upon request of an institution, treat an organisationally, structurally and financially independent and autonomous unit of that institution as a public development credit institution, provided that the unit fulfils all the conditions listed in the first subparagraph and that such treatment does not affect the effectiveness of the supervision of that institution. Competent authorities shall without delay notify the Commission and EBA of any decision to treat, for the purposes of this subparagraph, a unit of an institution as a public development credit institution. The competent authority shall annually review such decision. 3.   For the purposes of points (d) and (e) of paragraph 1 and point (d) of paragraph 2, \u2018promotional loan\u2019 means a loan granted by a public development credit institution or an entity set up by the central government, regional government or local authority of a Member State, directly or through an intermediate credit institution on a non-competitive, not-for-profit basis, in order to promote the public policy objectives of the central government, regional government or local authority in a Member State. 4.   Institutions shall not exclude the trade exposures referred to in points (g) and (h) of paragraph 1 of this Article, where the condition set out in the third subparagraph of Article 429(5) is not met. 5.   Institutions may exclude the exposures listed in point (n) of paragraph 1 where both of the following conditions are met:\n(a) the institution's competent authority has determined, after consultation with the relevant central bank, and publicly declared that exceptional circumstances exist that warrant the exclusion in order to facilitate the implementation of monetary policies;\n(b) the exemption is granted for a limited period of time not exceeding one year. 6.   The exposures to be excluded under point (n) of paragraph 1 shall meet both of the following conditions:\n(a) they are denominated in the same currency as the deposits taken by the institution;\n(b) their average maturity does not significantly exceed the average maturity of the deposits taken by the institution. 7.   By way of derogation from point (d) of Article 92(1), where an institution excludes the exposures referred to in point (n) of paragraph 1 of this Article, it shall at all times satisfy the following adjusted leverage ratio requirement for the duration of the exclusion:\nwhere:\naLR\n=\nthe adjusted leverage ratio;\nEMLR\n=\nthe institution's total exposure measure as defined in Article 429(4), including the exposures excluded in accordance with point (n) of paragraph 1 of this Article; and\nCB\n=\nthe amount of exposures excluded in accordance with point (n) of paragraph 1 of this Article.\nArticle 429b\nCalculation of the exposure value of assets 1.   Institutions shall calculate the exposure value of assets, excluding derivative contracts listed in Annex II, credit derivatives and the positions referred to in Article 429e in accordance with the following principles:\n(a) the exposure values of assets means an exposure value as referred to in the first sentence of Article 111(1);\n(b) securities financing transactions shall not be netted. 2.   A cash pooling arrangement offered by an institution does not violate the condition set out in point (b) of Article 429(7) only where the arrangement meets both of the following conditions:\n(a) the institution offering the cash pooling arrangement transfers the credit and debit balances of several individual accounts of entities of a group included in the arrangement (\u2018original accounts\u2019) into a separate, single account and thereby sets the balances of the original accounts to zero;\n(b) the institution carries out the actions referred to in point (a) of this subparagraph on a daily basis.\nFor the purposes of this paragraph and paragraph 3, cash pooling arrangement means an arrangement whereby the credit or debit balances of several individual accounts are combined for the purposes of cash or liquidity management. 3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 2 of this Article, a cash pooling arrangement that does not meet the condition set out in point (b) of that paragraph, but meets the condition set out in point (a) of that paragraph, does not violate the condition set out in point (b) of Article 429(7), provided that the arrangement meets all the following conditions:\n(a) the institution has a legally enforceable right to set off the balances of the original accounts through the transfer into a single account at any point in time;\n(b) there are no maturity mismatches between the balances of the original accounts;\n(c) the institution charges or pays interest based on the combined balance of the original accounts;\n(d) the competent authority of the institution considers that the frequency by which the balances of all original accounts are transferred is adequate for the purpose of including only the combined balance of the cash pooling arrangement in the total exposure measure. 4.   By way of derogation from point (b) of paragraph 1, institutions may calculate the exposure value of cash receivable and cash payable under securities financing transactions with the same counterparty on a net basis only where all the following conditions are met:\n(a) the transactions have the same explicit final settlement date;\n(b) the right to set off the amount owed to the counterparty with the amount owed by the counterparty is legally enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency and bankruptcy;\n(c) the counterparties intend to settle on a net basis or to settle simultaneously, or the transactions are subject to a settlement mechanism that results in the functional equivalent of net settlement. 5.   For the purposes of point (c) of paragraph 4, institutions may consider that a settlement mechanism results in the functional equivalent of net settlement only where, on the settlement date, the net result of the cash flows of the transactions under that mechanism is equal to the single net amount under net settlement and all the following conditions are met:\n(a) the transactions are settled through the same settlement system or settlement systems using a common settlement infrastructure;\n(b) the settlement arrangements are supported by cash or intraday credit facilities intended to ensure that the settlement of the transactions will occur by the end of the business day;\n(c) any issues arising from the securities legs of the securities financing transactions do not interfere with the completion of the net settlement of the cash receivables and payables.\nThe condition set out in point (c) of the first subparagraph is met only where the failure of any securities financing transaction in the settlement mechanism may delay settlement of only the matching cash leg or may create an obligation to the settlement mechanism, supported by an associated credit facility.\nWhere there is a failure of the securities leg of a securities financing transaction in the settlement mechanism at the end of the window for settlement in the settlement mechanism, institutions shall split out this transaction and its matching cash leg from the netting set and treat them on a gross basis.\nArticle 429c\nCalculation of the exposure value of derivatives 1.   Institutions shall calculate the exposure value of derivative contracts listed in Annex II and of credit derivatives, including those that are off-balance-sheet, in accordance with the method set out in Section 3 of Chapter 6 of Title II of Part Three.\nWhen calculating the exposure value, institutions may take into account the effects of contracts for novation and other netting agreements in accordance with Article 295. Institutions shall not take into account cross-product netting, but may net within the product category as referred to in point (25)(c) of Article 272 and credit derivatives where they are subject to a contractual cross-product netting agreement as referred to in point (c) of Article 295. Institutions shall include in the total exposure measure sold options even where their exposure value can be set to zero in accordance with the treatment laid down in Article 274(5). 2.   Where the provision of collateral related to derivative contracts reduces the amount of assets under the applicable accounting framework, institutions shall reverse that reduction. 3.   For the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions calculating the replacement cost of derivative contracts in accordance with Article 275 may recognise only collateral received in cash from their counterparties as the variation margin referred to in Article 275, where the applicable accounting framework has not already recognised the variation margin as a reduction of the exposure value and where all the following conditions are met:\n(a) for trades not cleared through a QCCP, the cash received by the recipient counterparty is not segregated;\n(b) the variation margin is calculated and exchanged at least daily based on a mark-to-market valuation of derivatives positions;\n(c) the variation margin received is in a currency specified in the derivative contract, governing master netting agreement, credit support annex to the qualifying master netting agreement or as defined by any netting agreement with a QCCP;\n(d) the variation margin received is the full amount that would be necessary to extinguish the mark-to-market exposure of the derivative contract subject to the threshold and minimum transfer amounts that are applicable to the counterparty;\n(e) the derivative contract and the variation margin between the institution and the counterparty to that contract are covered by a single netting agreement that the institution may treat as risk-reducing in accordance with Article 295. Where an institution provides cash collateral to a counterparty and that collateral meets the conditions set out in points (a) to (e) of the first subparagraph, the institution shall consider that collateral as the variation margin posted with the counterparty and shall include it in the calculation of the replacement cost.\nFor the purposes of point (b) of the first subparagraph, an institution shall be considered to have met the condition set out therein where the variation margin is exchanged on the morning of the trading day following the trading day on which the derivative contract was stipulated, provided that the exchange is based on the value of the contract at the end of the trading day on which the contract was stipulated.\nFor the purposes of point (d) of the first subparagraph, where a margin dispute arises, institutions may recognise the amount of non-disputed collateral that has been exchanged. 4.   For the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions shall not include collateral received in the calculation of NICA as defined in point (12a) of Article 272, except in the case of derivative contracts with clients where those contracts are cleared by a QCCP. 5.   For the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions shall set the value of the multiplier used in the calculation of the potential future exposure in accordance with Article 278(1) to one, except in the case of derivative contracts with clients where those contracts are cleared by a QCCP. 6.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions may use the method set out in Section 4 or 5 of Chapter 6 of Title II of Part Three to determine the exposure value of derivative contracts listed in points 1 and 2 of Annex II, but only where they also use that method for determining the exposure value of those contracts for the purpose of meeting the own funds requirements set out in Article 92. Where institutions apply one of the methods referred to in the first subparagraph, they shall not reduce the total exposure measure by the amount of margin they have received.\nArticle 429d\nAdditional provisions on the calculation of the exposure value of written credit derivatives 1.   For the purposes of this Article, \u2018written credit derivative\u2019 means any financial instrument through which an institution effectively provides credit protection including credit default swaps, total return swaps and options where the institution has the obligation to provide credit protection under conditions specified in the options contract. 2.   In addition to the calculation laid down in Article 429c, institutions shall include in the calculation of the exposure value of written credit derivatives the effective notional amounts referenced in the written credit derivatives reduced by any negative fair value changes that have been incorporated in Tier 1 capital with respect to those written credit derivatives.\nInstitutions shall calculate the effective notional amount of written credit derivatives by adjusting the notional amount of those derivatives to reflect the true exposure of the contracts that are leveraged or otherwise enhanced by the structure of the transaction. 3.   Institutions may fully or partly reduce the exposure value calculated in accordance with paragraph 2 by the effective notional amount of purchased credit derivatives, provided that all the following conditions are met:\n(a) the remaining maturity of the purchased credit derivative is equal to or greater than the remaining maturity of the written credit derivative;\n(b) the purchased credit derivative is otherwise subject to the same or more conservative material terms as those in the corresponding written credit derivative;\n(c) the purchased credit derivative is not purchased from a counterparty that would expose the institution to Specific Wrong-Way risk, as defined in point (b) of Article 291(1);\n(d) where the effective notional amount of the written credit derivative is reduced by any negative change in fair value incorporated in the institution's Tier 1 capital, the effective notional amount of the purchased credit derivative is reduced by any positive fair value change that has been incorporated in Tier 1 capital;\n(e) the purchased credit derivative is not included in a transaction that has been cleared by the institution on behalf of a client or that has been cleared by the institution in its role as a higher-level client in a multi-level client structure and for which the effective notional amount referenced by the corresponding written credit derivative is excluded from the total exposure measure in accordance with point (g) or (h) of the first subparagraph of Article 429a(1), as applicable.\nFor the purpose of calculating the potential future exposure in accordance with Article 429c(1), institutions may exclude from the netting set the portion of a written credit derivative which is not offset in accordance with the first subparagraph of this paragraph and for which the effective notional amount is included in the total exposure measure. 4.   For the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 3, \u2018material term\u2019 means any characteristic of the credit derivative that is relevant to the valuation thereof, including the level of subordination, the optionality, the credit events, the underlying reference entity or pool of entities, and the underlying reference obligation or pool of obligations, with the exception of the notional amount and the residual maturity of the credit derivative. Two reference names shall be the same only where they refer to the same legal entity. 5.   By way of derogation from point (b) of paragraph 3, institutions may use purchased credit derivatives on a pool of reference names to offset written credit derivatives on individual reference names within that pool where the pool of reference entities and the level of subordination in both transactions are the same. 6.   Institutions shall not reduce the effective notional amount of written credit derivatives where they buy credit protection through a total return swap and record the net payments received as net income, but do not record any offsetting deterioration in the value of the written credit derivative in Tier 1 capital. 7.   In the case of purchased credit derivatives on a pool of reference obligations, institutions may reduce the effective notional amount of written credit derivatives on individual reference obligations by the effective notional amount of purchased credit derivatives in accordance with paragraph 3 only where the protection purchased is economically equivalent to buying protection separately on each of the individual obligations in the pool.\nArticle 429e\nCounterparty credit risk add-on for securities financing transactions 1.   In addition to the calculation of the exposure value of securities financing transactions, including those that are off-balance-sheet in accordance with Article 429b(1), institutions shall include in the total exposure measure an add-on for counterparty credit risk calculated in accordance with paragraph 2 or 3 of this Article, as applicable. 2.   Institutions shall calculate the add-on for transactions with a counterparty that are not subject to a master netting agreement that meets the conditions set out in Article 206 on a transaction-by-transaction basis in accordance with the following formula:\nwhere:\n=\nthe add-on;\ni\n=\nthe index that denotes the transaction;\nEi\n=\nthe fair value of securities or cash lent to the counterparty under transaction i; and\nCi\n=\nthe fair value of securities or cash received from the counterparty under transaction i.\nInstitutions may set \n equal to zero where Ei is the cash lent to a counterparty and the associated cash receivable is not eligible for the netting treatment set out in Article 429b(4). 3.   Institutions shall calculate the add-on for transactions with a counterparty that are subject to a master netting agreement that meets the conditions set out in Article 206 on an agreement-by-agreement basis in accordance with the following formula:\nwhere:\n=\nthe add-on;\ni\n=\nthe index that denotes the netting agreement;\nEi\n=\nthe fair value of securities or cash lent to the counterparty for the transactions that are subject to master netting agreement i; and\nCi\n=\nthe fair value of securities or cash received from the counterparty that is subject to master netting agreement i. 4.   For the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 3, the term counterparty includes also tri-party agents that receive collateral in deposit and manage the collateral in the case of tri-party transactions. 5.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions may use the method set out in Article 222, subject to a 20 % floor for the applicable risk weight, to determine the add-on for securities financing transactions including those that are off-balance-sheet. Institutions may use that method only where they also use it for calculating the exposure value of those transactions for the purpose of meeting the own funds requirements as set out in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 92(1). 6.   Where sale accounting is achieved for a repurchase transaction under the applicable accounting framework, the institution shall reverse all sales-related accounting entries. 7.   Where an institution acts as an agent between two parties in a securities financing transaction, including an off-balance-sheet transaction, the following provisions shall apply to the calculation of the institution's total exposure measure:\n(a) where the institution provides an indemnity or guarantee to one of the parties in the securities financing transaction and the indemnity or guarantee is limited to any difference between the value of the security or cash the party has lent and the value of collateral the borrower has provided, the institution shall only include the add-on calculated in accordance with paragraph 2 or 3, as applicable, in the total exposure measure;\n(b) where the institution does not provide an indemnity or guarantee to any of the involved parties, the transaction shall not be included in the total exposure measure;\n(c) where the institution is economically exposed to the underlying security or the cash in the transaction to an amount greater than the exposure covered by the add-on, it shall include in the total exposure measure also the full amount of the security or the cash to which it is exposed;\n(d) where the institution acting as agent provides an indemnity or guarantee to both parties involved in a securities financing transaction, the institution shall calculate its total exposure measure in accordance with points (a), (b) and (c) separately for each party involved in the transaction.\nArticle 429f\nCalculation of the exposure value of off-balance-sheet items 1.   Institutions shall calculate, in accordance with Article 111(1), the exposure value of off-balance-sheet items, excluding derivative contracts listed in Annex II, credit derivatives, securities financing transactions and positions referred to in Article 429d.\nWhere a commitment refers to the extension of another commitment, Article 166(9) shall apply. 2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, institutions may reduce the credit exposure equivalent amount of an off-balance-sheet item by the corresponding amount of specific credit risk adjustments. The calculation shall be subject to a floor of zero. 3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions shall apply a conversion factor of 10 % to low-risk off-balance-sheet items referred to in point (d) of Article 111(1).\nArticle 429g\nCalculation of the exposure value of regular-way purchases and sales awaiting settlement 1.   Institutions shall treat cash related to regular-way sales and securities related to regular-way purchases which remain on the balance sheet until the settlement date as assets in accordance with point (a) of Article 429(4). 2.   Institutions that, in accordance with the applicable accounting framework, apply trade date accounting to regular-way purchases and sales which are awaiting settlement shall reverse out any offsetting between cash receivables for regular-way sales awaiting settlement and cash payables for regular-way purchase awaiting settlement allowed under that framework. After institutions have reversed out the accounting offsetting, they may offset between those cash receivables and cash payables where both the related regular-way sales and purchases are settled on a delivery-versus-payment basis. 3.   Institutions that, in accordance with the applicable accounting framework, apply settlement date accounting to regular-way purchases and sales which are awaiting settlement shall include in the total exposure measure the full nominal value of commitments to pay related to regular-way purchases.\nInstitutions may offset the full nominal value of the commitments to pay related to regular-way purchases by the full nominal value of cash receivables related to regular-way sales awaiting settlement only where both of the following conditions are met:\n(a) both the regular-way purchases and sales are settled on a delivery-versus-payment basis;\n(b) the financial assets bought and sold that are associated with cash payables and receivables are fair valued through profit and loss and included in the institution's trading book.\n(*13)  Directive 2008/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2008 on credit agreements for consumers and repealing Council Directive 87/102/EEC (OJ L 133, 22.5.2008, p. 66).\u2019\n                                                      \"\n                        \n(118) the following part is inserted after Article 429g:\n                                       \u2018PART SEVEN A\nREPORTING REQUIREMENTS\nArticle 430\nReporting on prudential requirements and financial information 1.   Institutions shall report to their competent authorities on:\n(a) own funds requirements, including the leverage ratio, as set out in Article 92 and Part Seven;\n(b) the requirements laid down in Articles 92a and 92b, for institutions that are subject to those requirements;\n(c) large exposures as set out in Article 394;\n(d) liquidity requirements as set out in Article 415;\n(e) the aggregate data for each national immovable property market as set out in Article 430a(1);\n(f) the requirements and guidance set out in Directive 2013/36/EU qualified for standardised reporting, except for any additional reporting requirement under point (j) of Article 104(1) of that Directive;\n(g) the level of asset encumbrance, including a breakdown by the type of asset encumbrance, such as repurchase agreements, securities lending, securitised exposures or loans.\nInstitutions exempted in accordance with Article 6(5) shall not be subject to the reporting requirement on the leverage ratio set out in point (a) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph on an individual basis. 2.   In addition to the reporting on the leverage ratio referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 and in order to enable the competent authorities to monitor leverage ratio volatility, in particular around reporting reference dates, large institutions shall report specific components of the leverage ratio to their competent authorities based on averages over the reporting period and the data used to calculate those averages. 3.   In addition to the reporting on prudential requirements referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, institutions shall report financial information to their competent authorities where they are one of the following:\n(a) an institution that is subject to Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002;\n(b) a credit institution that prepares its consolidated accounts in accordance with the international accounting standards pursuant to point (b) of Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002. 4.   Competent authorities may require credit institutions that determine their own funds on a consolidated basis in accordance with international accounting standards pursuant to Article 24(2) to report financial information in accordance with this Article. 5.   The reporting on financial information referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 shall only comprise information that is needed to provide a comprehensive view of the institution's risk profile and the systemic risks posed by the institution to the financial sector or the real economy as set out in Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. 6.   The reporting requirements laid down in this Article shall be applied to institutions in a proportionate manner taking into account the report referred to in paragraph 8, having regard to their size, complexity and the nature and level of risk of their activities. 7.   EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to specify the uniform reporting formats and templates, the instructions and methodology on how to use those templates, the frequency and dates of reporting, the definitions and the IT solutions for the reporting referred to in paragraphs 1 to 4. Any new reporting requirements set out in such implementing technical standards shall not be applicable earlier than six months from the date of their entry into force.\nFor the purposes of paragraph 2, the draft implementing technical standards shall specify which components of the leverage ratio shall be reported using day-end or month-end values. For that purpose, EBA shall take into account both of the following:\n(a) how susceptible a component is to significant temporary reductions in transaction volumes that could result in an underrepresentation of the risk of excessive leverage at the reporting reference date;\n(b) developments and findings at international level.\nEBA shall submit to the Commission the draft implementing technical standards referred to in this paragraph by 28 June 2021, except in relation to the following:\n(a) the leverage ratio, which shall be submitted by 28 June 2020;\n(b) the obligations laid down in Articles 92a and 92b, which shall be submitted by 28 June 2020. Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. 8.   EBA shall assess the costs and benefits of the reporting requirements laid down in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 (*14) in accordance with this paragraph and report its findings to the Commission by 28 June 2020. That assessment shall be carried out in particular in relation to small and non-complex institutions. For those purposes, the report shall:\n(a) classify institutions into categories based on their size, complexity and the nature and level of risk of their activities;\n(b) measure the reporting costs incurred by each category of institutions during the relevant period to meet the reporting requirements set out in Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014, taking into account the following principles:\n(i) the reporting costs shall be measured as the ratio of the reporting costs relative to the institution's total costs during the relevant period;\n(ii) the reporting costs shall comprise all expenditure related to the implementation and operation on an on-going basis of the reporting systems, including expenditure on staff, IT systems, legal, accounting, auditing and consultancy services;\n(iii) the relevant period shall refer to each annual period during which institutions have incurred reporting costs to prepare for the implementation of the reporting requirements laid down in Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 and to continue operating the reporting systems on an on-going basis;\n(c) assess whether the reporting costs incurred by each category of institutions were proportionate with regard to the benefits delivered by the reporting requirements for the purposes of prudential supervision;\n(d) assess the effects of a reduction of reporting requirement on costs and supervisory effectiveness; and\n(e) make recommendations on how to reduce reporting requirements at least for small and non-complex institutions, to which end EBA shall target an expected average cost reduction of at least 10 % but ideally a 20 % cost reduction. EBA shall, in particular, assess whether:\n(i) the reporting requirements referred to in point (g) of paragraph 1 could be waived for small and non-complex institutions where asset encumbrance was below a certain threshold;\n(ii) the reporting frequency required in accordance with points (a), (c), and (g) of paragraph 1 could be reduced for small and non-complex institutions.\nEBA shall accompany that report by draft implementing technical standards referred to in paragraph 7. 9.   Competent authorities shall consult EBA on whether institutions, other than those referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4, should report on financial information on a consolidated basis in accordance with paragraph 3, provided that all the following conditions are met:\n(a) the relevant institutions are not already reporting on a consolidated basis;\n(b) the relevant institutions are subject to an accounting framework in accordance with Directive 86/635/EEC;\n(c) financial reporting is considered necessary to provide a comprehensive view of the risk profile of those institutions' activities and of the systemic risks they pose to the financial sector or the real economy as set out in Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to specify the formats and templates that institutions referred to in the first subparagraph shall use for the purposes set out therein.\nPower is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the second subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. 10.   Where a competent authority considers information not covered by the implementing technical standards referred to in paragraph 7 as necessary for the purposes set out in paragraph 5, it shall notify EBA and the ESRB of the additional information it considers necessary to include in the implementing technical standards referred to in that paragraph. 11.   Competent authorities may waive the requirement to submit any of the data points set out in the reporting templates specified in the implementing technical standards referred to in this Article where those data points are duplicative. For those purposes, duplicative data points shall refer to any data points which are already available to the competent authorities by means other than by collecting those reporting templates, including where those data points can be obtained from data that is already available to the competent authorities in different formats or levels of granularity; the competent authority may only grant the waivers referred to in this paragraph if data received, collated or aggregated through such alternative methods are identical to those data points which would otherwise have to be reported in accordance with the respective implementing technical standards.\nCompetent authorities, resolution authorities and designated authorities shall make use of data exchange wherever possible to reduce reporting requirements. The provisions on the exchange of information and professional secrecy as laid down in Section II of Chapter I of Title VII of Directive 2013/36/EU shall apply.\nArticle 430a\nSpecific reporting obligations 1.

Where an institution has a branch in another Member State, the data relating to that branch shall also be reported to the competent authorities of the host Member State. The data shall be reported separately for each immovable property market within the Union to which the relevant institution is exposed. 3.   The competent authorities shall publish annually on an aggregated basis the data specified in points (a) to (f) of paragraph 1, together with historical data, where available.

Institutions referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall report separately the calculations set out in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 325c(2) for the portfolio of all trading book positions or non-trading book positions that are subject to foreign exchange and commodity risks. 3.   In addition to the requirement set out in paragraph 1 of this Article, from the end of a three-year-period following the date of entry into force of the latest regulatory technical standards referred to in Articles 325bd(7), 325be(3), 325bf(9), 325bg(4), institutions shall report, for those positions assigned to trading desks for which they have been granted permission by the competent authorities to use the alternative internal model approach in accordance with Article 325az(2), the results of the calculations based on using that approach set out in Chapter 1b of Title IV of Part Three on the same basis as such institutions report the obligations laid down in points (b)(i) and (c) of Article 92(3). 4.   For the purposes of the reporting requirement in paragraph 3 of this Article, institutions shall report separately the calculations set out in points (a)(i), (a)(ii), (b)(i) and (b)(ii) of Article 325ba(1) and for the portfolio of all trading book positions or non-trading book positions that are subject to foreign exchange and commodity risks assigned to trading desks for which the institution has been granted permission by the competent authorities to use the alternative internal model approach in accordance with Article 325az(2). 5.   Institutions may use in combination the approaches referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3 within a group, provided that the calculation under the approach referred to in paragraph 1 does not exceed 90 % of the total calculation.

EBA shall prepare a report on feasibility regarding the development of a consistent and integrated system for collecting statistical data, resolution data and prudential data and report its findings to the Commission by 28 June 2020. 2.   When drafting the feasibility report, EBA shall involve competent authorities, as well as authorities that are responsible for deposit guarantee schemes, resolution and in particular the ESCB. The report shall take into account the previous work of the ESCB regarding integrated data collections and shall be based on an overall cost and benefit analysis including as a minimum:\n(a) an overview of the quantity and scope of the current data collected by the competent authorities in their jurisdiction and of its origins and granularity;\n(b) the establishment of a standard dictionary of the data to be collected, in order to increase the convergence of reporting requirements as regards regular reporting obligations, and to avoid unnecessary queries;\n(c) the establishment of a joint committee, including as a minimum EBA and the ESCB, for the development and implementation of the integrated reporting system;\n(d) the feasibility and possible design of a central data collection point for the integrated reporting system, including requirements to ensure strict confidentiality of the data collected, strong authentication and management of access rights to the system and cybersecurity, which:\n(i) contains a central data register with all statistical data, resolution data and prudential data in the necessary granularity and frequency for the particular institution and is updated at necessary intervals;\n(ii) serves as a point of contact for the competent authorities, where they receive, process and pool all data queries, where queries can be matched with existing collected reported data and which allows the competent authorities quick access to the requested information;\n(iii) provides additional support to the competent authorities for the transmission of data queries to the institutions and enters the requested data into the central data register;\n(iv) holds a coordinating role for the exchange of information and data between competent authorities; and\n(v) takes into account the proceedings and processes of competent authorities and transfers them into a standardised system. 3.   By one year after the presentation of the report referred to in this Article, the Commission shall, if appropriate and taking into account the feasibility report by EBA, submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a legislative proposal for the establishment of a standardised and integrated reporting system for reporting requirements.\n(*14)  Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 of 16 April 2014 laying down implementing technical standards with regard to supervisory reporting of institutions according to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 191, 28.6.2014, p. 1).\u2019;\"\n                        \n(119) Part Eight is replaced by the following:\n                                       \u2018PART EIGHT\nDISCLOSURE BY INSTITUTIONS\nTITLE I\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\nArticle 431\nDisclosure requirements and policies 1.

In the absence of a Council implementing act to reject the draft national measures within one month of receipt of the proposal by the Commission, the Member State concerned may adopt the measures and apply them for a period of up to two years or until the macroprudential or systemic risk ceases to exist if that occurs sooner. 5.

On the basis of that report, the Commission shall, if appropriate, submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a legislative proposal.\u2019;\n(136) the following article is inserted:\n\u2018Article 504a\nHoldings of eligible liabilities instruments\nBy 28 June 2022, EBA shall report to the Commission on the amounts and distribution of holdings of eligible liabilities instruments among institutions identified as G-SIIs or O-SIIs and on potential impediments to resolution and the risk of contagion in relation to those holdings.\nBased on the report by EBA the Commission shall, by 28 June 2023, report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the appropriate treatment of such holdings, accompanied by a legislative proposal, where appropriate.\u2019;\n(137) Article 507 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Article 507\nLarge exposures 1.   EBA shall monitor the use of exemptions set out in point (b) of Article 390(6), points (f) to (m) of Article 400(1), point (a) and points (c) to (g), (i), (j) and (k) of Article 400(2) and by 28 June 2021 submit a report to the Commission assessing the quantitative impact that the removal of those exemptions or the setting of a limit on their use would have. That report shall assess, in particular, for each exemption provided for in those Articles:\n(a) the number of large exposures exempted in each Member State;\n(b) the number of institutions that make use of the exemption in each Member State;\n(c) the aggregate amount of exposures exempted in each Member State. 2.   By 31 December 2023, the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the application of the derogations referred to in Articles 390(4) and 401(2) concerning the methods for the calculation of exposure value of securities financing transactions, and in particular the need to take account of amendments in international standards determining the methods for such calculation.\u2019;\n(138) in Article 510, the following paragraphs are added:\n\u20184.   EBA shall monitor the amount of required stable funding covering the funding risk linked to the derivative contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivatives over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio, in particular the future funding risk for those derivative contracts set out in Articles 428s(2) and 428at(2), and report to the Commission on the opportunity to adopt a higher required stable funding factor or a more risk-sensitive measure by 28 June 2024. That report shall at least assess:\n(a) the opportunity to distinguish between margined and unmargined derivative contracts;\n(b) the opportunity to remove, increase or replace the requirement set out in Articles 428s(2) and 428at(2);\n(c) the opportunity to change more broadly the treatment of derivative contracts in the calculation of the net stable funding ratio, as set out in Article 428d, Articles 428k(4) and 428s(2), points (a) and (b) of Article 428ag, Articles 428ah(2), 428al(4) and 428at(2), points (a) and (b) of Article 428ay and Article 428az(2), to better capture the funding risk linked to those contracts over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio;\n(d) the impact of the proposed changes on the amount of stable funding required for institutions' derivative contracts. 5.   If international standards affect the treatment of derivative contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivatives for the calculation of the net stable funding ratio, the Commission shall, if appropriate and taking into account the report referred to in paragraph 4, those changes of international standards and the diversity of the banking sector in the Union, submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council on how to amend the provisions regarding the treatment of derivative contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivatives for the calculation of the net stable funding ratio as set out in Title IV of Part Six to take better account of the funding risk linked to those transactions. 6.   EBA shall monitor the amount of stable funding required to cover the funding risk linked to securities financing transactions, including to the assets received or given in those transactions, and to unsecured transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers and report to the Commission on the appropriateness of that treatment by 28 June 2023. That report shall at least assess:\n(a) the opportunity to apply higher or lower stable funding factors to securities financing transactions with financial customers and to unsecured transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers to take better account of their funding risk over the one-year horizon of the net stable funding ratio and of the possible contagion effects between financial customers;\n(b) the opportunity to apply the treatment set out in point (g) of Article 428r(1) to securities financing transactions collateralised by other types of assets;\n(c) the opportunity to apply stable funding factors to off-balance-sheet items used in securities financing transactions as an alternative to the treatment set out in Article 428p(5);\n(d) the adequacy of the asymmetric treatment between liabilities with a residual maturity of less than six months provided by financial customers that are subject to a 0 % available stable funding factor in accordance with point (c) of Article 428k(3) and assets resulting from transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers that are subject to a 0 %, 5 % or 10 % required stable funding factor in accordance with point (g) of Article 428r(1), point (c) of Article 428s(1) and point (b) of Article 428v;\n(e) the impact of the introduction of higher or lower required stable funding factors for securities financing transactions, in particular with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers, on the market liquidity of assets received as collateral in those transactions, in particular of sovereign and corporate bonds;\n(f) the impact of the proposed changes on the amount of stable funding required for those institutions' transactions, in particular for securities financing transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers where sovereign bonds are received as collateral in those transactions. 7.   By 28 June 2024, the Commission shall, where appropriate and taking into account the report referred to in paragraph 6, any international standards and the diversity of the banking sector in the Union, submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council on how to amend the provisions regarding the treatment of securities financing transactions, including of the assets received or given in those transactions, and the treatment of unsecured transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers for the calculation of the net stable funding ratio as set out in Title IV of Part Six where it considers it appropriate regarding the impact of the existing treatment on institutions' net stable funding ratio and to take better account of the funding risk linked to those transactions. 8.   By 28 June 2025, the required stable funding factors applied to the transactions referred to in point (g) of Article 428r(1), point (c) of Article 428s(1) and in point (b) of Article 428v, shall be raised from 0 % to 10 %, from 5 % to 15 % and from 10 % to 15 % respectively, unless otherwise specified in a legislative act adopted on the basis of a proposal by the Commission, in accordance with paragraph 7 of this Article. 9.   EBA shall monitor the amount of stable funding required to cover the funding risk linked to institutions' holdings of securities to hedge derivative contracts. EBA shall report on the appropriateness of the treatment by 28 June 2023. That report shall at least assess:\n(a) the possible impact of the treatment on investors' ability to gain exposure to assets and the impact of the treatment on credit supply in the capital markets union;\n(b) the opportunity to apply adjusted stable funding requirements to securities that are held to hedge derivatives which are funded by initial margin, either wholly or in part;\n(c) the opportunity to apply adjusted stable funding requirements to securities that are held to hedge derivatives which are not funded by initial margin. 10.   By 28 June 2023 or a year after an agreement on international standards that is developed by the BCBS, whichever is the earliest, the Commission shall, where appropriate and taking into account the report referred to in paragraph 9, any international standards developed by the BCBS, the diversity of the banking sector in the Union and the aims of the capital markets union, submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council on how to amend the provisions regarding the treatment of institutions' holdings of securities to hedge derivative contracts for the calculation of the net stable funding ratio as set out in Title IV of Part Six where it considers it appropriate regarding the impact of the existing treatment on institutions' net stable funding ratio and to take better account of the funding risk linked to those transactions. 11.   EBA shall assess whether it would be justified to reduce the required stable funding factor for assets used for providing clearing and settlement services of precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum and palladium or assets used for providing financing transactions of precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum and palladium of a term of 180 days or less. EBA shall submit its report to the Commission by 28 June 2021.\u2019;\n(139) Article 511 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Article 511\nLeverage 1.   The Commission shall by 31 December 2020 submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on whether:\n(a) it is appropriate to introduce a leverage ratio surcharge for O-SIIs; and\n(b) the definition and calculation of the total exposure measure referred to in Article 429(4), including the treatment of central bank reserves, is appropriate. 2.   For the purposes of the report referred to in paragraph 1, the Commission shall take into account international developments and internationally agreed standards. Where appropriate, that report shall be accompanied by a legislative proposal.\u2019;\n(140) Article 513 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Article 513\nMacroprudential rules 1.   By 30 June 2022, and every five years thereafter, the Commission shall, after consulting the ESRB and EBA, review whether the macroprudential rules contained in this Regulation and in Directive 2013/36/EU are sufficient to mitigate systemic risks in sectors, regions and Member States including assessing:\n(a) whether the current macroprudential tools in this Regulation and in Directive 2013/36/EU are effective, efficient and transparent;\n(b) whether the coverage and the possible degrees of overlap between different macroprudential tools for targeting similar risks in this Regulation and in Directive 2013/36/EU are adequate and, if appropriate, propose new macroprudential rules;\n(c) how internationally agreed standards for systemic institutions interact with the provisions in this Regulation and in Directive 2013/36/EU and, if appropriate, propose new rules taking into account those internationally agreed standards;\n(d) whether other types of instruments, such as borrower-based instruments, should be added to the macroprudential tools provided for in this Regulation and in Directive 2013/36/EU to complement capital-based instruments and to allow for the harmonised use of the instruments in the internal market; taking into account whether harmonised definitions of those instruments and the reporting of respective data at Union level are a prerequisite for the introduction of such instruments;\n(e) whether the leverage ratio buffer requirement as referred to in Article 92(1a) should be extended to systemically important institutions other than G-SIIs, whether its calibration should be different from the calibration for G-SIIs, and whether its calibration should depend on the level of systemic importance of the institution;\n(f) whether the current voluntary reciprocity of macroprudnetial measures should be turned into mandatory reciprocity and whether the current ESRB framework for voluntary reciprocity is an appropriate basis for that;\n(g) how relevant Union and national macroprudential authorities can be mandated with tools to address new emerging systemic risks arising from credit institutions exposures to the non-banking sector, in particular from derivatives and securities financing transactions markets, the asset management sector and the insurance sector. 2.   By 31 December 2022, and every five years thereafter, the Commission shall, on the basis of the consultation with the ESRB and EBA, report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the assessment referred to in paragraph 1 and, where appropriate, submit a legislative proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council.\u2019;\n(141) Article 514 is replaced by the following:\n\u2018Article 514\nMethod for the calculation of the exposure value of derivative transactions 1.   EBA shall, by 28 June 2023, report to the Commission on the impact and the relative calibration of the approaches set out in Sections 3, 4 and 5 of Chapter 6 of Title II of Part Three to calculate the exposure values of derivative transactions. 2.   On the basis of the report by EBA, the Commission shall, where appropriate, submit a legislative proposal to amend the approaches set out in Sections 3, 4 and 5 of Chapter 6 of Title II of Part Three.\u2019;\n(142) the following article is inserted:\n\u2018Article 518a\nReview of cross-default provisions\nBy 28 June 2022, the Commission shall review and assess whether it is appropriate to require that eligible liabilities may be bailed-in without triggering cross-default clauses in other contracts, with a view to reinforcing as much as possible the effectiveness of the bail-in tool and to assessing whether a no-cross-default provision referring to eligible liabilities should be included in the terms or contracts governing other liabilities. Where appropriate, that review and assessment shall be accompanied by a legislative proposal.\u2019;\n(143) the following article is inserted:\n\u2018Article 519b\nOwn funds requirements for market risk 1.   By 30 September 2019, EBA shall report on the impact, on institutions in the Union, of international standards to calculate the own funds requirements for market risk. 2.   By 30 June 2020, the Commission shall, taking into account the results of the report referred to in paragraph 1 and the international standards and the approaches set out in Chapters 1a and 1b of Title IV of Part Three, submit a report together with a legislative proposal, where appropriate, to the European Parliament and to the Council on how to implement international standards on adequate own funds requirements for market risk.\u2019;\n(144) in Part Ten, the following title is inserted:\n                                       \u2018TITLE IIA\nIMPLEMENTATION OF RULES\nArticle 519c\nCompliance tool 1.   EBA shall develop an electronic tool aimed at facilitating institutions' compliance with this Regulation and Directive 2013/36/EU, as well as with regulatory technical standards, implementing technical standards, guidelines and templates adopted to implement this Regulation and that Directive. 2.   The tool referred to in paragraph 1 shall at least enable each institution to:\n(a) rapidly identify the relevant provisions to comply with in relation to the institution's size and business model;\n(b) follow the changes made in legislative acts and in the related implementing provisions, guidelines and templates.\u2019;\n(145) Annex II is amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.",
